Image sizes for posts:

Thumbnails:
* Long horizontal images that go above posts
** Don't show up on the page
* 1500 X 500 is a good size???
* 4 X 1 is a good ratio for thumbnails

feature-img: 
* Just use the rainbow for all

For image paths, you can add {{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ to them all by using [Sublime to edit all files at once](https://superuser.com/a/1429522/755644).
