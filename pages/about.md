This is the (mostly) data science and machine learning blog of Julius Simonelli built on top of Jekyll using the [Type-on-Strap theme](https://github.io/sylhare/Type-on-Strap). All images are mine unless otherwise noted. Feel free to contact me at julius.simonelli "at" gmail.com.

Note: I consider these posts living documents. If you see something that could be better or more up-to-date please let me know. This also means the dates on the blog posts are not necessarily correct, as I continue to add to posts or move posts around to be better organized. Also, if I add a later post in a series, I will back date it to fit with the rest of the series.
