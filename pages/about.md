This is the (mostly) data science and machine learning blog of Julius Simonelli built on top of Jekyll using the [Type-on-Strap theme](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap). All images are mine unless otherwise noted. Feel free to contact me at julius.simonelli "at" gmail.com.

I try to keep key posts up-to-date and ensure that they run with the latest versions of Python and important packages. If you see something that could be better or more up-to-date please let me know.
