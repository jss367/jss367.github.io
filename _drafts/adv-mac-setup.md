## Use Vimium-c

esc to move focus back to the window. then f to start vimium c

Then you can enter any of the text to click on that part. In addition:

j/k to move up and down the page. shift + J/K to move tabs

You'll need to disable it on some sites. For example, if you use j/k to navigate youtube videos, you'll need to disable it there.


## Use AltTab

Make sure you only select windows from open spaces.

## Use Spaceman

Download the fork, not the original. It's here: https://ruittenb.github.io/Spaceman/

# Notes

mac setup notes:

Core rule change: stop binding apps, start binding windows

Set exactly:

❌ Automatically rearrange Spaces → OFF

❌ When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows → OFF

✅ Displays have separate Spaces → ON

❌ Stage Manager → OFF

aerospace reads from:
~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml



The rule of thumb

Route apps that define a task → IDE, Terminal, Slack, Email

Do NOT route apps that are tools used inside a task → Chrome, Preview, Finder

Chrome is a tool, not a task.
