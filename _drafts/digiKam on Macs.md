digiKam on Macs.


# Adding New Images

For some reasons, USB Storage Devices and Card Readers don't show up, so I have to import from folders.




Import -> Add Folders

Then click Download to get the photos... that only works if you want them all. If you just want some, you have to select them and right-click.

You can flip in and out of Preview mode by hitting fn + F3.

You can go through the images and rate them. Hold down command then hit 1-5. You can also give them flags by holding down option and hitting 1,2 or 3.

Tools -> Maintenance -> Scan for new items


There's a progress window down at the bottom.

Many of the themes don't have a good night mode on mac, so I use fusion.
