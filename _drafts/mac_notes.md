option + shift + - for em dash



On macOS, apps are foregrounded as a whole, not per-window. When you click a Chrome icon in the Dock, macOS brings all Chrome windows forward. Same if you use cmd + tab to switch.

One work around is to right click the dock icon and select the specific window you want.



I don't like the way mac desktops work at first. If you jump to a window or something, you it can pull you to another desktop. To change this, you can go to options, then assign to, then All. The problem is, now if you open, say, chrome, it will open with all the tabs that are present in your chrome on another desktop. This also isn't ideal.
