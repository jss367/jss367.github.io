option + shift + - for em dash



On macOS, apps are foregrounded as a whole, not per-window. When you click a Chrome icon in the Dock, macOS brings all Chrome windows forward. Same if you use cmd + tab to switch.

One work around is to right click the dock icon and select the specific window you want.
