the fun button moves to the upper level

There's a guide here: https://shop.keyboard.io/pages/typing-on-the-model-100

Some key parts:
Enter is Return on a Mac and Enter on a PC
Cmd is Cmd on a Mac and the Windows key on a PC
Alt is Option on a Mac and Left Alt on a PC
The butterfly is Right Option on a Mac and Right Alt on a PC
Bksp is Delete on a Mac and Backspace on a PC
(Fn-Bksp is Forward Delete on a Mac and Delete on a PC)


Out of the box, both function keys work the same: If you drop and hold either palm onto the function key, the Model 100 switches into “function mode”.

H, J, K, L become your arrow keys
U, I, O, P become {, }, [, and ] respectively
W, A, S, D will move the mouse cursor
R, F, V will act as your mouse buttons


The Model 100’s default layout includes an embedded numpad. To access it, just tap the Num key in the upper-right corner of the keyboard.

Note: The LEDS help with this. They show which part of the keyboard is the number pad.


## moving around the line

there's no home or end buttin, so instead you use the following:

### End of the line:

Cmd + → → jump to end of the line

Cmd + ← → jump to start of the line

### End of the word

* Option + → → next word

* Option + ← → previous word

### End of the document / page

Different thing entirely:

Cmd + ↓ → bottom of page

Cmd + ↑ → top of page



### highlighting multiple lines of text.

hold shift while using the function button to move.

## Chrysalis

I didn't find Chrysalis intuitive at first but I found a guide for it:

https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis/wiki/A-Tour-of-Chrysalis

Here's an example of how to use it. Say you want to remap the butterfly key to option + space (to call Alfred, for example). First, click on the key you're remapping. Then, on the KEYBOARD tab you select space bar, then on the MODIFIERS tab you select Alt.

It should look like this when you're done.
