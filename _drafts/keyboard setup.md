the fun buttin moves to thed uooer level

There's a guide here: https://shop.keyboard.io/pages/typing-on-the-model-100

Some key parts:
Enter is Return on a Mac and Enter on a PC
Cmd is Cmd on a Mac and the Windows key on a PC
Alt is Option on a Mac and Left Alt on a PC
The butterfly is Right Option on a Mac and Right Alt on a PC
Bksp is Delete on a Mac and Backspace on a PC
(Fn-Bksp is Forward Delete on a Mac and Delete on a PC)


Out of the box, both function keys work the same: If you drop and hold either palm onto the function key, the Model 100 switches into “function mode”.

H, J, K, L become your arrow keys
U, I, O, P become {, }, [, and ] respectively
W, A, S, D will move the mouse cursor
R, F, V will act as your mouse buttons


The Model 100’s default layout includes an embedded numpad. To access it, just tap the Num key in the upper-right corner of the keyboard.

Note: The LEDS help with this. They show which part of the keyboard is the number pad.
