setting up chezmoi



~/git/dotfiles main !1 ❯ chezmoi managed                                                                                                 base

So even if you cloned your dotfiles repo into ~/git/dotfiles, chezmoi isn’t watching that. It’s managing its own clone of the repo, and you’re supposed to do all dotfile changes either:

In-place (e.g., edit ~/.zshrc then chezmoi add ~/.zshrc)

Or inside chezmoi cd (to modify templates or source-controlled files)




Key Principle: Chezmoi is the source of truth
You should:

Edit files in ~/.zshrc

Track them with chezmoi (which copies them into ~/.local/share/chezmoi in a Git-friendly format)

Then commit from inside chezmoi's source dir

So:
✅ ~/.zshrc — where you live-edit
✅ ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc — chezmoi’s Git-managed version



This also means that chezmoi is the only repo that isn't with my other repos.



After you edit a file:

* `chezmoi diff`
* `chezmoi add ~/.profile`

Then, commit and push the change:
* `chezmoi cd`
* `git add dot_profile`
* `git commit -m "Update profile"`
* `git push`
