Darktable


Out of the box:

Can't use left and right arrow keys to move between images

- it's space and backspace... you need to remap these






I had to change the way I reviewed images. I used to `x` to select the images to delete, but now I use ratings. 0-5
You can do `r` as well (for reject)


`g` for grid view is now..

`e` is now `d` for darkroom


The instructions say this:
Since darktable assigns a 1 star rating to newly-imported images by default, this will show all of the images you have just imported.

Don't think it was true for me




In views column, it should show the hot key for lighttable and darkroom... `d` for darkroom






lighttable:
W fully zooms into the current image while the key is pressed


Top tips:

Press and hold letter `h` to see keyboard shortcuts 




Import options:

Default is: $(PICTURES_FOLDER)/Darktable

I want to put this on my NAS, so I change it to: `/Users/julius/Library/CloudStorage/SynologyDrive-Mac/Pictures`


sub directory naming pattern: `$(YEAR)$(MONTH)$(DAY)_$(JOBCODE)`

I change it to:

$(JOBCODE)/$(YEAR)$(MONTH)$(DAY)

$(JOBCODE)/$(YEAR)/$(YEAR)-$(MONTH)-$(DAY)


$(JOBCODE)/$(EXIF_YEAR)/$(EXIF_YEAR)-$(EXIF_MONTH)-$(EXIF_DAY)


So it might be USA/date




I select keep original filename, but you don't have to.


/Users/julius/Library/CloudStorage/SynologyDrive-Mac/Pictures/no_name/20240709/_D854086.NEF


When you import, make sure to include the import job (e.g. USA)

/Users/julius/Library/CloudStorage/SynologyDrive-Mac/Pictures/USA/20240709/_D854098.NEF


You can hit `d` to switch between views



No quick way to see export, open file location
no right click menu





zooming is done with the cursor. You middle click or scroll to zoom


## Awesome features

Map is great


## Reasons I'm not using it:

Too slow
