synology drive


turn off versions, do snapshots instead







You'll have files in /Users/julius/Library/CloudStorage/SynologyDrive-Mac

The Library folder is hidden by default



You'll also have files in /Users/julius/SynologyDrive, and the logo matches

This has disk_usage


These do not sync!!!! You don't want this




You also have mapped a network drive, where you can go to /home
/home is syncd to SynologyDrive-Mac, so they should be the same

This doesn't have disk_usage






Sometimes you'll be in your SynologyDrive folder and the cloud options will go away. The best thing to do in that case is to go to the Synology Drive Client and pause it, then start it again. Then go into a new finder and click SynologyDrive. They should appear again. You'll get the icons and the right-click capabilities
