# OpenSearch Dashboards Guide

## Introduction

OpenSearch Dashboards is a visualization tool for data stored in OpenSearch, the open source logs search tool maintained by AWS. OpenSearch Dashboards provides a browser-based interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data. This guide covers the essential components and operations of OpenSearch Dashboards.

### Discover

The Discover tab allows for direct exploration of your data:

- Search bar: Enter queries using Lucene or OpenSearch Query DSL
- Time filter: Limit results to specific time ranges
- Field list: Select which fields to display in the results
- Document table: View individual documents matching your search criteria
- Histogram: Visualize document distribution over time

### Index Patterns

Start by selecting an index pattern on the left. It might look something like `dev-ml-*` or `prod-ml-*`.

### Search

The search can be a little tricky to use. If you have a file like `ABC-DEF_MYFILE100.pdf`, it won't pop up if you search `"MYFILE100"`. You may need to search for `"DEF_MYFILE100"`. Note that you need quotes.

## Visualizations

There's also support for visualizations, though I haven't played with them yet. I'll update this if I do.

## Advanced Features

There are also some advanced features. I haven't gone through them all yet.

### Dashboards

Combine visualizations into dashboards:

1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Click "Create new dashboard"
3. Add visualizations using "Add an existing visualization"
4. Arrange and resize visualizations
5. Save the dashboard

### Dev Tools

Access the Console interface for direct API interaction:

1. Go to Dev Tools > Console
2. Enter OpenSearch API calls using JSON format
3. Execute queries with Ctrl+Enter or the play button

### Aggregations

Implement aggregation queries for data analysis:

```json
GET my_index/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "avg_value": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alerting

Configure alerts based on index conditions:

1. Navigate to Alerting
2. Create monitors that define:
   - Index pattern to monitor
   - Trigger conditions
   - Alert destinations (email, Slack, webhook)

## Optimizations

Here are some initial optimization tips.

### Dashboard Optimization

- Limit the number of visualizations per dashboard
- Implement data rollups for historical data

### Query Optimization

- Use specific field filters rather than full-text searches
- Implement document-level security for access control
- Cache frequently used queries
- Monitor cluster performance metrics
