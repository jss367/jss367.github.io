a guide to ebooks


## Spotify

* Lots of people already have this. 

* Only 12? hours of listening a month

* You can find the pdf for audiobooks on your phone, but not on the desktop

## Prime Reading


No Kindle needed
works on iOS and Android
Mac?

* Very small selection





## Kindle Unlimited

I tried Kindle Unlimited and found the selection (no pun intended), limited



## Libby

* Free
* Great
* Moderate selection

You can't company text from the Libby app, so you have to do that with the kindle app. Directions here: https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6017.htm

Go into "Manage Loan" -> "Read With..."

This doesn't work for all books for some reason.
