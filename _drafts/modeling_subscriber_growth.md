There are a lot of ways to do this and it depends on what your inputs are. In this post I'll show how to work with subscriber growth as it comes out of Substack, although it should work in many cases.


## The Equation

Let's talk about the equation

$$ \Delta S_t = r \cdot S_{t-1}\left(1 - \frac{S_{t-1}}{K}\right) + g(a_t) + \gamma \cdot \text{pulse}_t + \varepsilon_t $$

St - subscribers at time t

S\_{t-1} - subscribers at time t-1

r - growth rate

K - carrying capacity

g(at) - ad effect

γpulse - pulse effect

εt - error

$$ \varepsilon_t $$ - error

$ \varepsilon_t $ - error
