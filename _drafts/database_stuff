If you have a query like:

query_string = f"""
select * from my_table where col = 123
"""

You can write a function that queries the database:

record = query_db(query_string, user, password, host, dbname="bvds")


Or you could use an ORM

If it's a raw string, you can just do this:

with db_session(engine=get_engine('bvds', db_name='bvds')) as sess:
    records = (sess.execute(query_string))

Note that you have to use execute



## Useful commands:


`update my_table set deleted=now() where ...`
