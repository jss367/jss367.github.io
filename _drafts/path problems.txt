Path Problems

Path problems are some of the most annoying and common problems when developing software, especially if you're bounding between operating systems.

There are so many different issues you could have. I'll try to explain a few and provide some background in the hope that that helps as well.




## Windows

Let's say you want to see your environment variables. Let's say it's your path. Unfortunately, it depends on what terminal emulator you're using. If you are on ConEmu or Cmder, you can

echo %PATH%

This can be hard to read so to make it easier you can: `echo %PATH:;=&echo.%`


However, if you're using Windows PowerShell, you'll have to:

echo $Env:PATH


On a Mac/Linux, you would be able to 

`echo $PATH`

This also works on Windows Subsystem for Linux

## VSCode

There is an integrated terminal in VSCode. You can set it but the default it Windows Powershell, so you'll have to

echo $Env:PATH


## Adding to path

If you want to temporarily add to path:
set PATH="%PATH%;C:\path\to\directory\"
set PATH="%PATH%;C:\Users\Julius\Documents\GitHub\DataManager"

If you want to permanently add to path:
setx path "%PATH%;C:\path\to\directory\"




On windows, if you echo $PYTHONPATH you get nothing, but if you print(sys.path) you see:
['c:\\Users\\Julius\\Documents\\GitHub\\ResNetFromScratch', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\python37.zip', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\DLLs', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\lib', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\lib\\site-packages', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\lib\\site-packages\\win32', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\lib\\site-packages\\win32\\lib', 'C:\\Users\\Julius\\anaconda3\\envs\\tf\\lib\\site-packages\\Pythonwin']

## Print Python from command line

python -c 'print("hello")'

But on Windows you'll need double quotes

python -c "print('hello')"

## Adding to your PYTHONPATH

Just go to system properties, environment variables, new...
c:\\Users\\Julius\\Documents\\GitHub\\DataManager
- for some reason this doesn't always add to the python path though




path problems

remember that your paths are hierarchical on windows

I you have C:\Users\Julius\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps it will try then then tell you to go to the windows store. But you can move the one you want up in the list.

You can have this problem where it works if you are debugging but not if you're not debugging.


add BOTH conda and python to your path

open conda prompt then `where conda`

then `where python`

should say
C:\Users\Julius\anaconda3\python.exe

so use C:\Users\Julius\anaconda3


Environment variables:
Hit windows key
type environment
Click on Environment Variables in the Advanced tab.

I use the User variables for this



Right-click anywhere in the editor window and select Run Python File in Terminal (which saves the file automatically):

- doesn't use selected interpreter





On a brand new Mac your path is:
default mac path

julius@Juliuss-MacBook-Pro ~ % echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin







on windows can also

echo $PYTHONPATH
set PYTHONPATH=C:\\Users\Julius\Documents\GitHub\facv\src\;C:\\Users\Julius\Documents\GitHub\fastai\fastai
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

but in Windows it's echo $PYTHONPATH$


In Powershell this works: echo $Env:PATH

but nothing works in the others (cmder, conemu)
not echo $PATH or $PATH$


Note:
If you change the environment variables you'll need to restart vscode or jupyter notebooks
once you restart you'll see it in sys.path
