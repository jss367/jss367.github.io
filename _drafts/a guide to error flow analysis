Fail fast.


If you're an AWS lambda instance, look for the things you expect right away. Then fail if they're not there.




Sometimes you're logs look "normal" other times they look like this:
{"asctime": "2025-05-28 11:49:45,555", "levelname": "INFO", "name": "__main__", "message": "My message here"}

This is a json formatter log.
