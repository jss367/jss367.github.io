mac setup notes:

Core rule change: stop binding apps, start binding windows

Set exactly:

❌ Automatically rearrange Spaces → OFF

❌ When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows → OFF

✅ Displays have separate Spaces → ON

❌ Stage Manager → OFF

aerospace reads from:
~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml



The rule of thumb (commit this to memory)

Route apps that define a task → IDE, Terminal, Slack, Email

Do NOT route apps that are tools used inside a task → Chrome, Preview, Finder

Chrome is a tool, not a task.
