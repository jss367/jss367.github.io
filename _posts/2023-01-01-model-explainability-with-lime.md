[Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) is an important technique for explaining the predictions of machine learning models. It is called "model-agnostic" because it can be used to explain any machine learning model, regardless of the model's architecture or how it was trained. The key to LIME is to "zoom in" on a decision boundary and learn an interpretable model around that specific area. Then we can see exactly how various factors affect the decision boundary. In this post, I'll show how to use LIME to explain an image classification model.

# Load the Data

Let's load an image that we'll use our model to predict.


```python
im_path = 'wallaby.jpg'
im = Image.open(im_path)
```

I'm going to resize it and then take a look at it.


```python
im.thumbnail((256, 256), resample=Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
```


```python
im
```

# Load the Model

Now let's get our model. For simplicity, I'm going to use an off-the-shelf one: InceptionV3.


```python
model = models.inception_v3(weights=Inception_V3_Weights.DEFAULT)
```

Set it to evaluation mode.


```python
model.eval();
```

# Prepare the Image

There are a few things we need to do to prepare the images. There's nothing just here - just some stuff for working with a PyTorch model. For one, we'll have to use the ImageNet mean and standard deviation to transform the image.


```python
IMAGENET_MEAN = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
IMAGENET_STD = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
```


```python
normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=IMAGENET_MEAN, std=IMAGENET_STD)
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), normalize])
```


```python
im_t = transform(im).unsqueeze(0)
```


```python
with open("imagenet_class_index.json", "r") as f:
    imagenet_classes_dict = json.load(f)
```


```python
imagenet_classes = [imagenet_classes_dict[str(i)][1] for i in range(len(imagenet_classes_dict))]
```

# Classify the Image


```python
logits = model(im_t)
```


```python
probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)
```


```python
pred = probs.topk(1)
```


```python
pred_prob = pred.values[0][0].detach().numpy()
```


```python
pred_index = pred.indices[0][0].numpy()
```


```python
print(f"We predicted {imagenet_classes[pred_index]} with a probability of {pred_prob:.2%}.")
```

    We predicted wallaby with a probability of 100.00%.
    

# Explain the Predictions

Now we can use LIME to explain our predictions. We start by making an instance of a `LimeImageExplainer`.


```python
explainer = LimeImageExplainer()
```

Next, we call the `explain_instance` method and pass it the image and the prediction. This method will return an explanation object, which contains the information about how the model made the prediction. We'll need a `batch_predict` function to pass to it.


```python
def batch_predict(images: list):
    """
    Generic batch prediction in PyTorch
    """
    model.eval()
    batch = torch.stack(tuple(transform(i) for i in images), dim=0)
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    model.to(device)
    batch = batch.to(device)
    logits = model(batch)
    probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)
    return probs.detach().cpu().numpy()
```

`explain_instance` takes several arguments. The `top_labels` parameter specifies the number of labels that the explanation should focus on. The `hide_color` parameter specifies whether the explanation should include color information. The `num_samples` parameter specifies the number of samples to use when approximating the model's behavior.


```python
explanation = explainer.explain_instance(np.array(im), batch_predict, top_labels=1, hide_color=0, num_samples=1000)
```


      0%|          | 0/1000 [00:00<?, ?it/s]



```python
img, mask = explanation.get_image_and_mask(explanation.top_labels[0], positive_only=False)
img_boundry = mark_boundaries(img / 255.0, mask)
plt.imshow(img_boundry)
plt.tick_params(left=False, right=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False, bottom=False)
```

Now we can look at the areas of the image that are highlighted in the image. These are the regions that the model attended to when making the prediction. We can see that the area covering the wallaby is green, indicating that those areas were positively associated with the class "wallaby" in the image. This is one way we can make sure the model is looking at what we expect it to.

It's also good to look at the weights that LIME assigns to each region. The weights indicate the relative importance of each region in the model's prediction. Regions with higher weights were more important for the prediction, while regions with lower weights were less important.
