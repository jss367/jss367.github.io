It's important to know whether a model has been trained well or not. One way to do this is to look at the model weights. But it's hard to know what exactly they're telling you - you need something to compare the weights to. In this post, I'm going to look at the weight statistics for a couple of well-trained networks, which can be used as comparison points.

We'll use well-known pre-trained models like VGG-16 and ResNet50. But before we do that, let's look at an untrained network so we can see how the weights change after they are trained. We'll see how the distribution changes from an untrained network to a trained one.

```

We're going to use models that are provided in `keras`. These are easy to work with and support random initialization, ImageNet weights, and loading custom weights. To start with, we'll use random weights. Let's download our model.

# Untrained VGG-16


```python
vgg_model_untrained = VGG16(weights=None)
```

Let's look at the model architecture.


```python
vgg_model_untrained.summary()
```

We'll look at the first and last convolution and dense (aka fully connected) layers and see how they change and why. We can get a list of all the layers by calling `.layers` like so:


```python
vgg_model_untrained.layers
```




    [<tensorflow.python.keras.engine.input_layer.InputLayer at 0x16c4df909c8>,
     <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D at 0x16c43ddbe88>,

     <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x16c4ecd3b48>,
     <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x16c4ecdea08>]



Now let's extract the weights.


```python
first_vgg_conv_weights_untrained, first_vgg_conv_biases_untrained = vgg_model_untrained.layers[1].get_weights()
last_vgg_conv_weights_untrained, last_vgg_conv_biases_untrained = vgg_model_untrained.layers[-6].get_weights()
first_vgg_fc_weights_untrained, first_vgg_fc_biases_untrained = vgg_model_untrained.layers[-3].get_weights()
last_vgg_fc_weights_untrained, last_vgg_fc_biases_untrained = vgg_model_untrained.layers[-1].get_weights()
```

## Untrained VGG-16 Convolutional Layers

We'll create a simple function to show summary statistics and plot a histogram.


```python
def print_stats(nparray):
    print("Shape: ", nparray.shape)
    print("Mean: ", np.mean(nparray))
    print("Standard Deviation: ", np.std(nparray))
    print("Variance: ", np.var(nparray))
    print("Min: ", np.min(nparray))
    print("Max: ", np.max(nparray))
```


```python
def plot_histo(nparray, model_name, layer, param):
    assert param in {'weights', 'biases'}
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.hist(np.asarray(nparray).flatten(), rwidth=0.9)
    plt.title(f"Plot of {model_name} {param} in {layer} layer")
    plt.xlabel("Value")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
```


```python
def summarize(nparray, model_name=None, layer=None, param=None):
    print_stats(nparray)
    plot_histo(nparray, model_name, layer, param)
```

Let's look at our first weights and biases


```python
summarize(first_vgg_conv_weights_untrained, 'VGG-16 random initialization', 'first convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (3, 3, 3, 64)
    Mean:  -2.0897362e-05
    Standard Deviation:  0.057159748
    Variance:  0.003267237
    Min:  -0.09954555
    Max:  0.09961195
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_20_1.png)



```python
print_stats(first_vgg_conv_biases_untrained)
```

    Shape:  (64,)
    Mean:  0.0
    Standard Deviation:  0.0
    Variance:  0.0
    Min:  0.0
    Max:  0.0
    

The first thing we see is that the weights and biases are initialized differently. Specifically, the weights are initialized to some distribution of random values and the biases are all initialized to 0.

But what is the distribution that the weights are initialized to? For a [convolutional layer, the weights are initialized to `glorot_uniform`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/2ea7d77bb08c1c989170528012b281c9ce1111ca/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L126). This is the initialization method described in [Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio. In TensorFlow it's called "Glorot initialization", but I see it more commonly referred to as "Xavier initialization".

We can confirm that this is what TensorFlow is doing by calling this method directly and seeing that it is the same.


```python
initializer = tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()
values = initializer(shape=(3, 3, 3, 64))
```


```python
print_stats(values)
```

    Shape:  (3, 3, 3, 64)
    Mean:  0.00015374094
    Standard Deviation:  0.056950122
    Variance:  0.0032433164
    Min:  -0.09963174
    Max:  0.09960838
    

Let's step through this process. The idea is to make the weights uniformly distributed between positive and negative $$ \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{fan_{in} + fan_{out}}}$$ 

`fan_in` is the number of input connections and `fan_out` is the number of output connections. So for `fan_in` that's the kernel size (3*3) times the number of input channels, which is 3. For `fan_out`, it's the kernel size times the number of output channels, which is 64.


```python
fan_in = 3*3*3
fan_out = 3*3*64
```

The variance, or `scale` as it is written in TensorFlow, is the inverse of the mean of those two.


```python
scale = 1 / ((fan_in + fan_out) / 2.)
scale
```




    0.003316749585406302



From there we can calculate the limit.


```python
limit = math.sqrt(3.0 * scale)
limit
```




    0.09975093361076329



Note what we've done is exactly the same as the original paper, the order is just a little bit different.

![Xavier init]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/xavier_init.png "Xavier init")

OK, now let's look at the next layer. We know the bias is going to be zero but we can look at the weights.


```python
summarize(last_vgg_conv_weights_untrained, 'VGG-16 random initialization', 'last convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (3, 3, 512, 512)
    Mean:  -1.52503735e-05
    Standard Deviation:  0.0147314165
    Variance:  0.00021701462
    Min:  -0.025515513
    Max:  0.025515452
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_35_1.png)


Now that there are so many values it's much easier to see that it's a uniform distribution. Also notice that the variance is much lower now. That's because there are many more connections coming into and going out of the layer. We can calculate the variance and limit as we did before.


```python
fan_in = 3*3*512
fan_out = 3*3*512
```


```python
scale = 1 / ((fan_in + fan_out) / 2.)
scale
```




    0.00021701388888888888




```python
limit = math.sqrt(3.0 * scale)
limit
```




    0.02551551815399144



And again we get the same values. Let's look at them again.


```python
initializer = tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()
values = initializer(shape=(3, 3, 512, 512))
```


```python
print_stats(values)
```

    Shape:  (3, 3, 512, 512)
    Mean:  -1.0009625e-05
    Standard Deviation:  0.014722626
    Variance:  0.00021675571
    Min:  -0.025515513
    Max:  0.0255155
    

## Untrained VGG-16 Fully Connected Layers

Now let's look at the fully connected layers. In the [TensorFlow code for fully connected layers](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b36436b087bd8e8701ef51718179037cccdfc26e/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/core.py#L1135), you'll also see that they use Xavier initialization. The first fully connected layer should have the lowest variance of all because it has the most connections.


```python
print_stats(first_vgg_fc_weights_untrained)
```

    Shape:  (25088, 4096)
    Mean:  1.5987824e-06
    Standard Deviation:  0.008278468
    Variance:  6.853302e-05
    Min:  -0.014338483
    Max:  0.014338479
    


```python
print_stats(first_vgg_fc_biases_untrained)
```

    Shape:  (4096,)
    Mean:  0.0
    Standard Deviation:  0.0
    Variance:  0.0
    Min:  0.0
    Max:  0.0
    

We see that the biases are still initialized to zero for the fully connected layers.

Now let's look at the last layer.


```python
print_stats(last_vgg_fc_weights_untrained)
```

    Shape:  (4096, 1000)
    Mean:  -3.772734e-06
    Standard Deviation:  0.019808477
    Variance:  0.00039237578
    Min:  -0.034313176
    Max:  0.03431317
    

The variance has increased compared with the first fully connected layer, as we expected.

# Pre-trained VGG-16


```python
vgg_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet')
```


```python
first_vgg_conv_weights, first_vgg_conv_biases = vgg_model.layers[1].get_weights()
last_vgg_conv_weights, last_vgg_conv_biases = vgg_model.layers[-6].get_weights()
first_vgg_fc_weights, first_vgg_fc_biases = vgg_model.layers[-3].get_weights()
last_vgg_fc_weights, last_vgg_fc_biases = vgg_model.layers[-1].get_weights()
```

## Pre-trained VGG-16 Convolutional Layers


```python
summarize(first_vgg_conv_weights, 'VGG-16', 'first convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (3, 3, 3, 64)
    Mean:  -0.0024379087
    Standard Deviation:  0.20669945
    Variance:  0.04272466
    Min:  -0.67140007
    Max:  0.6085159
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_55_1.png)


Looks like by the time the model is done training it ends up with closer to a uniform distribution.

And now the biases.


```python
summarize(first_vgg_conv_biases, 'VGG-16', 'first convolutional', 'biases')
```

    Shape:  (64,)
    Mean:  0.5013912
    Standard Deviation:  0.32847992
    Variance:  0.10789906
    Min:  -0.015828926
    Max:  2.064037
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_58_1.png)


Now they've both changed but note that the distributions for the weights and biases are different. The weights are even centered around a mean of around 0 while the biases have a mean around 0.5 and range from 0 to 2.

If we compare them to the untrained weights, we see that the mean has stayed close to 0, but the variance and range have increased substantially.

Now let's look at the last layers.


```python
summarize(last_vgg_conv_weights, 'VGG-16', 'last convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (3, 3, 512, 512)
    Mean:  -0.0010818949
    Standard Deviation:  0.008478405
    Variance:  7.1883354e-05
    Min:  -0.09288482
    Max:  0.28699666
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_62_1.png)



```python
summarize(last_vgg_conv_biases, 'VGG-16', 'last convolutional', 'biases')
```

    Shape:  (512,)
    Mean:  0.14986369
    Standard Deviation:  0.4928213
    Variance:  0.24287283
    Min:  -0.50036746
    Max:  9.431553
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_63_1.png)


It's interesting... It looks like the variance of the weights in convolutional layers decrease as we go deeper into the network. They all get closer and closer to zero. Let's see if we can visualize that.

First we'll extract all the convolutional layers.


```python
vgg_conv_layers = [layer for layer in vgg_model.layers if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Conv2D)]
```


```python
vgg_conv_layers
```




    [<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D at 0x16c4f0fd708>,

    return weight_sums

Yes, the variance does appear to drop in later layers. The biggest drop is after the first layer.

## Pre-trained VGG-16 Fully Connected Layers

Now let's look at the fully connected layers.


```python
summarize(first_vgg_fc_weights, 'VGG-16', 'first fully connected', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (25088, 4096)
    Mean:  -0.00014126883
    Standard Deviation:  0.0023069018
    Variance:  5.3217964e-06

The variance increases in the layer with fewer connections, just like it did with our initialization scheme.

Now let's look at ResNet50.

# ResNet50

ResNet50 was first proposed in the paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun.


```python
resnet_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
```

## ResNet50 Convolutional Layers

Now we'll look at a convolutional layer inside the network. I'll just grab one from a bit deeper inside.


```python
resnet_model.layers[25]
```




    <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D at 0x16cf2609ac8>




```python
resnet_model.layers[-6]
```




    <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D at 0x16cf3b6ca88>




```python
first_resnet_conv_weights, first_resnet_conv_biases = resnet_model.layers[2].get_weights()
mid_resnet_conv_weights, mid_resnet_conv_biases = resnet_model.layers[25].get_weights()
last_resnet_conv_weights, last_resnet_conv_biases = resnet_model.layers[-6].get_weights()
```

Weights and biases are not the same. Note that the first biases are basically 0.


```python
summarize(first_resnet_conv_weights, 'ResNet50', 'first convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (7, 7, 3, 64)
    Mean:  -0.00048973627
    Standard Deviation:  0.111119024
    Variance:  0.012347437
    Min:  -0.6710244
    Max:  0.70432377
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_90_1.png)



```python
summarize(first_resnet_conv_biases, 'ResNet50', 'first convolutional', 'biases')
```

    Shape:  (64,)
    Mean:  4.5632303e-11
    Standard Deviation:  2.104375e-09
    Variance:  4.428394e-18
    Min:  -4.4311914e-09
    Max:  7.641752e-09

The biases are interesting. It appears that all the biases in the first layer are basically 0.

Now let's look at a middle layer.


```python
summarize(mid_resnet_conv_weights, 'ResNet50', 'middle convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (1, 1, 64, 256)
    Mean:  -0.0009927782
    Standard Deviation:  0.037277624
    Variance:  0.0013896213
    Min:  -0.24024516
    Max:  0.27957112
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_94_1.png)


Looks like the variance has decreased by an order of magnitude. Even more of that values are close to zero now.


```python
print_stats(mid_resnet_conv_biases)
```

    Shape:  (256,)
    Mean:  0.0
    Standard Deviation:  0.0
    Variance:  0.0
    Min:  0.0
    Max:  0.0
    

Wow, the biases are all completely zero here. That seems very strange to me.


```python
summarize(last_resnet_conv_weights, 'ResNet50', 'last convolutional', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (1, 1, 512, 2048)
    Mean:  -0.0004575059
    Standard Deviation:  0.014726251
    Variance:  0.00021686249
    Min:  -0.1346324
    Max:  0.29996708

The variance has continued to shrink, again by about and order of magnitude. It looks like as you get further into the network the weights get smaller and smaller, just as we saw with VGG-16. Let's verify that again.


```python
resnet_conv_layers = [layer for layer in resnet_model.layers if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Conv2D)]
```


```python
resnet_weight_sums = get_weight_sums(resnet_conv_layers)
```


```python
plot_layer_mean_weight(resnet_weight_sums, 'ResNet')
```


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_102_0.png)



```python
print_stats(last_resnet_conv_biases)
```

    Shape:  (2048,)
    Mean:  0.0
    Standard Deviation:  0.0
    Variance:  0.0
    Min:  0.0
    Max:  0.0
    

Biases are still zero. I guess there's just no need for them.

## ResNet50 Fully Connected Layers


```python
resnet_fc_weights, resnet_fc_biases = resnet_model.layers[-1].get_weights()
```


```python
summarize(resnet_fc_weights, 'ResNet50', 'fully connected', 'weights')
```

    Shape:  (2048, 1000)
    Mean:  3.7746946e-07
    Standard Deviation:  0.03353968
    Variance:  0.00112491
    Min:  -0.2103586
    Max:  0.73615897
    


![png]({{site.baseurl}}/asserts/img/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_files/2020-08-03-Inspecting-Model-Weights_107_1.png)



```python
summarize(resnet_fc_biases, 'ResNet50', 'fully connected', 'biases')
```

    Shape:  (1000,)
    Mean:  -4.8816204e-08
    Standard Deviation:  0.009334726
    Variance:  8.713711e-05
    Min:  -0.024051076
    Max:  0.029003482

Now it looks like the biases have formed into a normal distribution.

# Takeaways

There are a lot of interesting things to note from this:
* VGG weights start uniformly distributed but naturally become normally distributed
* The biases in the first convolutional layer of ResNet50 are present, but by the middle and end they are 0
* There are, however, biases in the ResNet50 fully connected layer
