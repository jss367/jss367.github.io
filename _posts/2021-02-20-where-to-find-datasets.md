As machine learning has continued to expand, so has the need for data. I've put together some of my favorite resources for finding datasets. I hope they are some service.

# Dataset search engines

* [US Government Data](https://www.data.gov/)

* [Google Cloud public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets)

* [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

* [Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/)

# Curated Lists of Datasets

Not to make this post a list of lists, but some of these are really good.

# Tools for getting datasets

This isn't a dataset, but I thought I would mention [PyDataset](https://github.com/iamaziz/PyDataset), a nice tool for quickly downloading datasets.
