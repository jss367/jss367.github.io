This post walks through recent work on [Discovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) by Burns et al. The paper uses latent knowledge in the model's activations to train the model. Their method answers yes-no questions accurately by identifying a direction in the activation space that adheres to logical consistency properties, such as having opposite truth values for a statement and its negation.

This post walks through the code to demonstrate the result. Much of it was taken directly from the [author's repo](https://github.com/collin-burns/discovering_latent_knowledge/tree/main).

# Data

The authors tested their approach on various datasets and found that it worked. In this post, we'll use the [amazon polarity](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon_polarity) dataset for simplicity.


```python
data = load_dataset("amazon_polarity")["test"]
```

    Found cached dataset amazon_polarity (/home/julius/.cache/huggingface/datasets/amazon_polarity/amazon_polarity/3.0.0/a27b32b7e7b88eb274a8fa8ba0f654f1fe998a87c22547557317793b5d2772dc)

Let's take a look at the dataset.


```python
for i in range(5):
    print(data[i])
    print()
```

    {'label': 1, 'title': 'Great CD', 'content': 'My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I\'m in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life\'s hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"'}
    
    {'label': 1, 'title': "One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play", 'content': "Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it."}
    
    {'label': 0, 'title': 'Batteries died within a year ...', 'content': 'I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.'}
    
    {'label': 1, 'title': 'works fine, but Maha Energy is better', 'content': "Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries."}
    
    {'label': 1, 'title': 'Great for the non-audiophile', 'content': "Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote."}
    
    

The labels correspond to the sentiment of the review. `1` indicates a positive review and `0` indicates a negative review.

Now let's take a closer look at the text.


```python
text = data[0]["content"]
```


```python
text
```




    'My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I\'m in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life\'s hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"'



Before it goes into the model we'll need to convert the text into statements that are either true or false. To do that, we can create a new statement saying that the review is positive, and another to say that it's negative. That way we'll be guaranteed to have one true and one false statement.


```python
def create_prompt_review(text: str, label: int) -> str:
    """
    Given a review (text) and its corresponding sentiment label (0 for negative or 1 for positive),
    creates a zero-shot prompt for the review by including the sentiment label as the answer.
    """
    sentiment = ["negative", "positive"][label]
    prompt = f"The following review expresses a {sentiment} sentiment:\n{text}"
    return prompt
```


```python
create_prompt_review(text, 0)
```




    'The following review expresses a negative sentiment:\nMy lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I\'m in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life\'s hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"'




```python
create_prompt_review(text, 1)
```




    'The following review expresses a positive sentiment:\nMy lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT.

Now we have statements that are either true or false. Let's get the hidden states from them.

## Extract hidden states

To do this, we'll need to tokenize the text. Then we'll run it through a model.

We'll need to grab a tokenizer that's right for our model. Fortunately, this is easy to do with `AutoTokenizer`.


```python
# specify where to cache the model weights
cache_dir = os.getenv('MODELS')

# Set the model to the desired device (e.g., CPU or GPU)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

We'll use the `deberta-v2-xxlarge` model, so here we'll grab the associated tokenizer.


```python
model_type = "encoder"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/deberta-v2-xxlarge", cache_dir=cache_dir)
```

    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
    

Let's take a look at some of the attributes of the tokenizer.


```python
print(f"Tokenizer Type: {type(tokenizer)}")
print(f"Model Type: {tokenizer.model_input_names}")
print(f"Vocabulary Size: {tokenizer.vocab_size}")
print(f"Max Model Input Sizes: {tokenizer.model_max_length}")
print(f"Padding Side: {tokenizer.padding_side}")
print(f"Special Tokens: {tokenizer.special_tokens_map}")
```

    Tokenizer Type: <class 'transformers.models.deberta_v2.tokenization_deberta_v2_fast.DebertaV2TokenizerFast'>
    Model Type: ['input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask']
    Vocabulary Size: 128000
    Max Model Input Sizes: 512
    Padding Side: right
    Special Tokens: {'bos_token': '[CLS]', 'eos_token': '[SEP]', 'unk_token': '[UNK]', 'sep_token': '[SEP]', 'pad_token': '[PAD]', 'cls_token': '[CLS]', 'mask_token': '[MASK]'}
    

Some of these attributes are worth going into a little more. "Vocabulary Size" refers to the number of unique tokens in the tokenizer's vocabulary. "Max Model Input Sizes" represents the maximum number of tokens the model can process in a single input sequence.

Now let's tokenize a piece to text to get a look at it.


```python
encoder_text_ids = tokenizer(text, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(device)
# encoder_text_ids = tokenizer(text, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
```


```python
encoder_text_ids
```

This looks good. We see the start token (`1`) at the beginning and the end token (`2`) at the end.

# Hidden States

#### Model

To get the hidden states we'll have to create our model.


```python
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/deberta-v2-xxlarge", cache_dir=cache_dir)
```

    Some weights of the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-v2-xxlarge were not used when initializing DebertaV2ForMaskedLM: ['lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.bias', 'deberta.embeddings.position_embeddings.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.weight']
    - This IS expected if you are initializing DebertaV2ForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
    - This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DebertaV2ForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
    Some weights of DebertaV2ForMaskedLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-v2-xxlarge and are newly initialized: ['cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias']
    You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
    


```python
type(model)
```




    transformers.models.deberta_v2.modeling_deberta_v2.DebertaV2ForMaskedLM



Let's move it to the appropriate device and set it to eval mode.


```python
model = model.to(device)
model.eval();
```

OK, now we've got our model. We can look at a summary of it.


```python
input_size = (1, 256)
dummy_input = torch.randint(0, model.config.vocab_size, size=input_size, dtype=torch.long, device=device)
summary(model, input_data=dummy_input)
```

We can also take a look at the configuration of the model.


```python
model.config
```




    DebertaV2Config {
      "_name_or_path": "microsoft/deberta-v2-xxlarge",
      "attention_head_size": 64,
      "attention_probs_dropout_prob": 0.1,
      "conv_act": "gelu",
      "conv_kernel_size": 3,
      "hidden_act": "gelu",
      "hidden_dropout_prob": 0.1,
      "hidden_size": 1536,
      "initializer_range": 0.02,
      "intermediate_size": 6144,
      "layer_norm_eps": 1e-07,
      "max_position_embeddings": 512,
      "max_relative_positions": -1,
      "model_type": "deberta-v2",
      "norm_rel_ebd": "layer_norm",
      "num_attention_heads": 24,
      "num_hidden_layers": 48,
      "pad_token_id": 0,
      "pooler_dropout": 0,
      "pooler_hidden_act": "gelu",
      "pooler_hidden_size": 1536,
      "pos_att_type": [
        "p2c",
        "c2p"
      ],
      "position_biased_input": false,
      "position_buckets": 256,
      "relative_attention": true,
      "share_att_key": true,
      "transformers_version": "4.28.1",
      "type_vocab_size": 0,
      "vocab_size": 128100
    }



We can see that the size of each attention head is 64 and there are 24 attention heads, thus the transformer has a hidden size of 64 * 24 = 1536. This means that there are 1536 intermediate representations of the data within that layer, which includes contextual information and information about the relationship between the tokens. 

We can also see that there are 48 hidden layers. This means that there are 48 transformer layers in the model.

Now let's do a simple forward pass through the model.


```python
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(encoder_text_ids, output_hidden_states=True)
```

We had 48 hidden layers, but we should expect one more hidden state because of the embedding layer. Let's check that.


```python
len(output.hidden_states)
```




    49



Looks good!

## Visualizing Activations

Visualizations of activations are not always easy to make sense of, but let's give it a try. We'll look at the last layer.


```python
layer = -1  # last layer

hs_tuple = output["hidden_states"]
hidden_states = hs_tuple[layer].cpu().numpy().squeeze()

# Apply t-SNE to reduce dimensionality
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
hidden_states_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(hidden_states)

# Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
hidden_states_pca = pca.fit_transform(hidden_states)

# Apply UMAP to reduce dimensionality
umap_reducer = umap.UMAP(n_components=2, random_state=42)
hidden_states_umap = umap_reducer.fit_transform(hidden_states)

# Create a function to plot the reduced hidden states
def plot_hidden_states(hidden_states, title):
    plt.figure()
    plt.scatter(hidden_states[:, 0], hidden_states[:, 1])
    plt.xlabel("Component 1")
    plt.ylabel("Component 2")
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()


# Plot the t-SNE, PCA, and UMAP reduced hidden states
plot_hidden_states(hidden_states_tsne, "t-SNE Visualization of Hidden States")
plot_hidden_states(hidden_states_pca, "PCA Visualization of Hidden States")
plot_hidden_states(hidden_states_umap, "UMAP Visualization of Hidden States")
```

It's always hard to know what this means. Let's look at it in 3D (commented out on the blog but you can uncomment `fig.show()` and run it to see the results).


```python
pca_3d = PCA(n_components=3)
hidden_states_pca_3d = pca_3d.fit_transform(hidden_states)

df = pd.DataFrame(hidden_states_pca_3d, columns=["Component 1", "Component 2", "Component 3"])

fig = px.scatter_3d(
    df,
    x="Component 1",
    y="Component 2",
    z="Component 3",
    color="Component 1",
    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Plasma,

## Getting Hidden States

Now, we're going to get all the hidden states. We'll get the ones with positive sentiment and negative sentiment.


```python
def get_encoder_hidden_states(model, tokenizer, input_text, layer=-1):
    """
    Given an encoder model and some text, gets the encoder hidden states (in a given layer, by default the last)
    on that input text (where the full text is given to the encoder).

    Returns a numpy array of shape (hidden_dim,)
    """
    # tokenize
    encoder_text_ids = tokenizer(input_text, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(model.device)

    # forward pass
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(encoder_text_ids, output_hidden_states=True)

    # get the appropriate hidden states
    hs_tuple = output["hidden_states"]

    hs = hs_tuple[layer][0, -1].detach().cpu().numpy()

    return hs
```


```python
model.eval()
all_neg_hs, all_pos_hs, all_gt_labels = [], [], []
n = 100

for _ in tqdm(range(n)):
    # for simplicity, sample a random example until we find one that's a reasonable length
    # (most examples should be a reasonable length, so this is just to make sure)
    while True:
        idx = np.random.randint(len(data))
        text, true_label = data[idx]["content"], data[idx]["label"]
        # the actual formatted input will be longer, so include a bit of a marign
        if len(tokenizer(text)) < 400:
            break

    # get hidden states
    neg_hs = get_encoder_hidden_states(model, tokenizer, create_prompt_review(text, 0))
    pos_hs = get_encoder_hidden_states(model, tokenizer, create_prompt_review(text, 1))

    # collect
    all_neg_hs.append(neg_hs)
    all_pos_hs.append(pos_hs)
    all_gt_labels.append(true_label)

X_neg = np.stack(all_neg_hs)
X_pos = np.stack(all_pos_hs)
y = np.stack(all_gt_labels)
```

    100%|█████████████████████████████████████████| 100/100 [00:16<00:00,  5.93it/s]
    

Now we have our hidden states. Let's split them into train and test sets.


```python
X_pos_train, X_pos_test, X_neg_train, X_neg_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_pos, X_neg, y, random_state=42
)
```

## Test Model Representations

The question is, do we have good representations of the data? The way to check this is to make a simple model. If logistic regression can't use the hidden states to classify the review, they're not any good.

We want to combine the positive and negative together and there are a few ways we could do that. The simplest way is just to subtract them.


```python
X_train = X_neg_train - X_pos_train
X_test = X_neg_test - X_pos_test
```


```python
lr = LogisticRegression(class_weight="balanced")
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Logistic regression accuracy: {lr.score(X_test, y_test)}")
```

    Logistic regression accuracy: 0.92
    

Yay! We've built good representations.

## Contrast-Consistent Search

Now let's use at Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS). You can learn more about it in the paper linked at the top.

The first step is to prepare the data by normalizing it and turning it into a Pytorch tensor.


```python
def normalize(x: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    normalized_x = x - x.mean(axis=0, keepdims=True)
    return normalized_x
```


```python
# Prepare data
X_neg_train_normed = normalize(X_neg_train)
X_pos_train_normed = normalize(X_pos_train)
```


```python
def convert_to_tensors(x0: np.ndarray, x1: np.ndarray, device: str) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    x0 = torch.tensor(x0, dtype=torch.float, device=device)
    x1 = torch.tensor(x1, dtype=torch.float, device=device)
    return x0, x1
```


```python
# Convert data to tensors
X_neg_train_tensor, X_pos_train_tensor = convert_to_tensors(X_neg_train_normed, X_pos_train_normed, device="cuda")

```

Now we can train with CCS. Note that we don't need any labels for this.

To do this, we'll need to create a probe. A probe is a simple model used in self-supervised learning to learn a task-specific representation from the features extracted by an unsupervised model. In this case,  the probe is a binary classifier that distinguishes between the two sets of samples.


```python
def create_probe(input_size: int, device: str) -> nn.Module:
    probe = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_size, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
    probe.to(device)
    return probe
```


```python
probe = create_probe(X_neg_train_tensor.shape[-1], "cuda")
```

The loss function is a crucial component of the CCS algorithm because it serves as the primary driving force behind the optimization of the model's parameters. In this specific case, the CCS algorithm aims to learn a binary classifier that can distinguish between two sets of samples.

The CCS loss function comprises two key components: the informative loss and the consistent loss. The informative loss encourages the model to minimize the squared difference between the probabilities assigned to the samples from both sets. This component of the loss function aims to make the model more discriminative, pushing it to assign higher probabilities to one set of samples and lower probabilities to the other set. In doing so, the model is encouraged to identify patterns or features that separate the two sets of samples, thus maximizing the information it can learn from the unlabeled data.

The consistent loss, on the other hand, focuses on ensuring that the model remains consistent in its predictions. This is achieved by penalizing the squared difference between the probabilities assigned to samples from x0 and the complement of the probabilities assigned to the corresponding samples from x1. By minimizing this component of the loss function, the model is encouraged to consistently assign complementary probabilities to samples from the two sets. This consistency is crucial for ensuring the model's robustness and preventing it from overfitting to spurious correlations in the training data.


```python
def get_loss(p0: torch.Tensor, p1: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    informative_loss = (torch.min(p0, p1) ** 2).mean(0)
    consistent_loss = ((p0 - (1 - p1)) ** 2).mean(0)
    return informative_loss + consistent_loss
```

We'll write a function that finds the best probe and returns it.


```python
def train(probe: nn.Module, 
          x0: torch.Tensor, 
          x1: torch.Tensor, 
          num_epochs: int, 
          lr: float, 
          weight_decay: float, 
          device: str) -> float:
    
    # Shuffle the input data
    permutation = torch.randperm(len(x0))
    x0, x1 = x0[permutation], x1[permutation]

    # Initialize the optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(probe.parameters(), lr=lr, weight_decay=weight_decay)

    # Set batch size and number of batches
    batch_size = len(x0)
    nbatches = len(x0) // batch_size

    # Training loop
    for _ in range(num_epochs):
        for j in range(nbatches):
            # Create input batches
            x0_batch = x0[j * batch_size : (j + 1) * batch_size]
            x1_batch = x1[j * batch_size : (j + 1) * batch_size]

            # Forward pass through the probe
            p0, p1 = probe(x0_batch), probe(x1_batch)

            # Calculate loss
            loss = get_loss(p0, p1)

            # Update the probe's parameters
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

    return loss.detach().cpu().item()
```


```python
def find_best_probe(
    probe: nn.Module,
    X_neg: torch.Tensor,
    X_pos: torch.Tensor,
    num_epochs: int,
    ntries: int,
    lr: float,
    weight_decay: float,
    device: str,
) -> tuple[nn.Module, float]:
    """

    best_loss = np.inf
    for _ in range(ntries):
        # Create and train a new probe for each attempt
        probe = create_probe(X_neg.shape[-1], device)
        loss = train(probe, X_neg, X_pos, num_epochs, lr, weight_decay, device)

        # Update the best probe if the current loss is lower
        if loss < best_loss:
            best_probe = copy.deepcopy(probe)
            best_loss = loss

    return best_probe, best_loss
```


```python
best_probe, best_loss = find_best_probe(probe, X_neg_train_tensor, X_pos_train_tensor, num_epochs=1000, ntries=10, lr=1e-3, 
                        weight_decay=0.01, device="cuda")
```

Now we can evaluate our results.


```python
def get_acc(probe: nn.Module, X_neg_test: np.ndarray, X_pos_test: np.ndarray, y_test: np.ndarray, device: str) -> float:
    """
    Compute the accuracy of the probe on the given test data.

    y_test: Test labels.

    Returns the accuracy of the probe on the test data.
    """
    # Normalize the test data
    x0_test_normalized = normalize(X_neg_test)
    x1_test_normalized = normalize(X_pos_test)

    # Convert the test data to tensors
    x0_test, x1_test = convert_to_tensors(x0_test_normalized, x1_test_normalized, device)

    # Compute probabilities with the best probe
    with torch.no_grad():
        p0, p1 = probe(x0_test), probe(x1_test)

    # Compute average confidence and predictions
    avg_confidence = 0.5 * (p0 + (1 - p1))
    predictions = (avg_confidence.detach().cpu().numpy() < 0.5).astype(int)[:, 0]

    # Calculate the accuracy
    acc = (predictions == y_test).mean()
    acc = max(acc, 1 - acc)

    return acc
```


```python
ccs_acc = get_acc(best_probe, X_neg_test, X_pos_test, y_test, device="cuda")
print(f"CCS accuracy: {ccs_acc}")
```

    CCS accuracy: 0.84
    

The final accuracy is pretty good! This indicates that the algorithm is able to learn meaningful patterns from the given data without the need for explicit labels.
