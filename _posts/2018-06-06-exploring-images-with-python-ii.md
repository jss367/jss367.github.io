This post shows some of the various tools in Python for visualizing images. There are usually two steps to the visualization process. First, you'll need to read in the image from a file path, usually as a `numpy` array or something similar. Then, you can visualize it with various libraries.

# Libraries

There are many libraries in Python to help with loading and processing images. Let's look at a few of them.


```python
from pyxtend import struct
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

## ImageIO

ImageIO is nice because it has a common interface for different image types.


```python
import imageio
import numpy as np
```


```python
image_path = '../roo.jpg'
```


```python
img_arr = imageio.v2.imread(image_path)
```


```python
struct(img_arr)
```




    {'ndarray': ['uint8, shape=(256, 192, 3)']}




```python
type(img_arr)
```




    numpy.ndarray




```python
isinstance(img_arr, np.ndarray)
```




    True



As you can see, `imageio.core.util.Array` is a NumPy ndarray.

### Time Test


```python
%timeit img_arr = imageio.v2.imread(image_path)
```

    877 µs ± 23.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    

## SKImage

SKImage is used for turning an image on disk into a numpy array, like so.


```python
import skimage
from skimage.io import imread
```


```python
image_path = '../roo.jpg'
```


```python
skimage_read = imread(image_path)
skimage_read
```

            [232, 236, 245],
            [232, 236, 245],
            ...,
            [227, 232, 236],

            [122, 134,  52],
            [119, 131,  49],
            ...,

            [ 99, 119,  24],
            [ 98, 118,  23]],
    
           [[121, 133,  51],
            [119, 131,  49],
            [116, 128,  46],
            ...,
            [101, 121,  26],
            [ 98, 118,  23],
            [ 96, 116,  21]]], dtype=uint8)




```python
struct(skimage_read)
```




    {'ndarray': ['uint8, shape=(256, 192, 3)']}



### Time Test


```python
%timeit skimage_read = imread(image_path)
```

    901 µs ± 18.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    

## PyTorch


```python
from torchvision.io import read_image
```


```python
torch_read = read_image(image_path)
torch_read
```




    tensor([[[232, 232, 232,  ..., 227, 227, 227],
             [232, 232, 232,  ..., 227, 227, 227],
             [232, 232, 232,  ..., 227, 227, 227],

             [121, 119, 116,  ..., 101,  98,  96]],
    
            [[236, 236, 236,  ..., 232, 232, 232],
             [236, 236, 236,  ..., 232, 232, 232],
             [236, 236, 236,  ..., 232, 232, 232],
             ...,
             [140, 138, 135,  ..., 123, 121, 120],
             [136, 134, 131,  ..., 122, 119, 118],
             [133, 131, 128,  ..., 121, 118, 116]],
    
            [[245, 245, 245,  ..., 236, 236, 236],
             [245, 245, 245,  ..., 236, 236, 236],
             [245, 245, 245,  ..., 236, 236, 236],
             ...,
             [ 58,  56,  53,  ...,  31,  29,  28],
             [ 54,  52,  49,  ...,  27,  24,  23],
             [ 51,  49,  46,  ...,  26,  23,  21]]], dtype=torch.uint8)




```python
struct(torch_read)
```




    {'Tensor': ['torch.uint8, shape=(3, 256, 192)']}



### Time Test


```python
%timeit torch_read = read_image(image_path)
```

    474 µs ± 4.75 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    

## TensorFlow


```python
import tensorflow as tf
```


```python
tf_image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
tf_image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(tf_image)
```


```python
struct(tf_image)
```




    {'EagerTensor': ["<dtype: 'uint8'>, shape=(256, 192, 3)"]}



### Time Test


```python
%timeit tf_image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(tf.io.read_file(image_path))
```

    707 µs ± 5.86 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    

## OpenCV

You can also read images off disk using OpenCV.


```python
import cv2
```


```python
img = cv2.imread(image_path)
```


```python
plt.imshow(img);
```

OpenCV uses BGR internally while most other libraries use RGB. This usually isn't an issue unless you read an image with `opencv` and try to plot it with, say, `matplotlib` (note the flipped color channels in the image above). Then you’ll need to switch the channels around. Here is how to do that.


```python
plt.imshow(img[:, :, ::-1]);
```

### Time Test


```python
%timeit cv2_img = cv2.imread(image_path)
```

    487 µs ± 5 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    

## PIL

You can also use PIL for this.


```python
from PIL import Image
```


```python
pil_img = Image.open(image_path) # This is already from an img
```




Note that PIL returns a special file type that you can display right away in a Jupyter Notebook.

```python
pil_img
```

### Time Test


```python
%timeit pil_img = Image.open(image_path)
```

    234 µs ± 4.71 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    

PIL is incredibly fast at reading images.



# Visualizing from TensorFlow Datasets


```python
import tensorflow as tf
```


```python
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

print("Number of training examples:", len(x_train))
print("Number of test examples:", len(x_test))
```

    Number of training examples: 60000
    Number of test examples: 10000
    


```python
print(y_train[0])

plt.imshow(x_train[0, :, :])
plt.colorbar();
```

    5

# Plotting Multiple Images

Here's an example of plotting multiple images with the label below it. It's commonly done to visualize datasets.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

from tensorflow.keras import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()


train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0
```


```python
class_names = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer',
               'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i][0]])
plt.show()
```
