The `dis` module is a great tool for understanding how code runs. While I mainly use it out of curiosity, it can also be valuable for optimization and debugging. The module allows you to translate your Python code into bytecode—a low-level, intermediate representation of your Python code. By examining bytecode, programmers can glimpse the Python interpreter's view of their code, shedding light on performance characteristics and operational behaviors that aren't apparent at the source code level.

In this post, we'll look into the `dis` module. We'll start by understanding what Python bytecode is and why it matters. Then, we'll dive into the basics of using the `dis` module, gradually advancing to its more intricate applications.

# Python Bytecode

First, let's understand what Python bytecode is. Bytecode is an intermediate, low-level representation of your Python code, generated by the Python interpreter. Unlike machine code, bytecode is not directly executed by the hardware but by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This layer of abstraction allows Python to maintain its platform independence, as the PVM takes care of translating bytecode into machine-specific instructions.

### Bytecode vs. Source Code vs. Machine Code

To appreciate the significance of bytecode, it's important to distinguish it from source code and machine code:

- **Source Code**: This is the code you write in Python, characterized by its readability and high-level syntax. It's the starting point of the execution process.
- **Bytecode**: When you run a Python program, the interpreter first compiles the source code into bytecode. This compilation happens automatically and is a step towards execution. Bytecode is more abstract than machine code and less readable than source code.
- **Machine Code**: The final step in the execution process is the translation of bytecode into machine code by the PVM. Machine code is a set of instructions executed directly by the computer's CPU.

# Getting Started with the dis Module

Now let's use the `dis` module. It's part of Python's standard library, so you don't need any additional installations to start using it. To begin, simply import the module into your Python script:

```python
import dis
```

The core function in the `dis` module is `dis.dis()`, which is used to disassemble Python functions, methods, and code objects. Here's a simple example:

```python
def doubler(x):
    return x * 2

dis.dis(doubler)
```

      1           0 RESUME                   0

      2           2 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
                  4 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
                  6 BINARY_OP                5 (*)
                 10 RETURN_VALUE

This code will output the disassembled bytecode of `example_function`. Let's talk about what all this means.

### Understanding the Disassembly Output

The output of `dis.dis()` typically includes the following columns:

- Line number: Indicates the line number in your source code.
- Byte offset: The position of the instruction in the bytecode sequence.
- Operation name: The human-readable name of the operation (e.g., `LOAD_FAST`, `BINARY_MULTIPLY`, etc.).
- Argument: Additional data needed for some operations (e.g., variable names, constants).
- Argument details: (in parentheses) Further explanation of the argument, such as variable names or constant values.

Let's look at our example. Each line corresponds to an instruction in the bytecode:

- `LOAD_FAST` loads the argument `x` onto the stack.
- `LOAD_CONST` loads the constant `2`.
- `BINARY_MULTIPLY` multiplies the two topmost items on the stack.
- `RETURN_VALUE` returns the result.

### Working with classes

The `dis` module can also disassemble methods within classes:

```python
class MyClass:
    def add_one(self, x):
        return x + 1

dis.dis(MyClass.add_one)
```

      2           0 RESUME                   0

      3           2 LOAD_FAST                1 (x)
                  4 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
                  6 BINARY_OP                0 (+)
                 10 RETURN_VALUE

# Advanced Usage of the `dis` Module

Now let's look at the more advanced capabilities of the `dis` module.

### Exploring the Bytecode Object with `dis.Bytecode`

For more detailed analysis, the `dis.Bytecode` class offers a richer interface. It provides an iterator over the individual instructions in the bytecode:

```python
for instruction in dis.Bytecode(MyClass.add_one):
    print(instruction.opname, instruction.argval)
```

    RESUME 0
    LOAD_FAST x
    LOAD_CONST 1
    BINARY_OP 0
    RETURN_VALUE None

This approach allows you to examine each operation in more detail and is particularly helpful for processing or analyzing the bytecode programmatically.

### Control Structures in Bytecode

You can also use `dis` to analyze control structures like loops and conditionals. Here's a simple for-loop:

```python
def for_loop_example():
    for i in range(3):
        print(i)

dis.dis(for_loop_example)
```

      1           0 RESUME                   0

      2           2 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (NULL + range)
                 12 LOAD_CONST               1 (3)
                 14 CALL                     1
                 22 GET_ITER
            >>   24 FOR_ITER                13 (to 54)
                 28 STORE_FAST               0 (i)

      3          30 LOAD_GLOBAL              3 (NULL + print)
                 40 LOAD_FAST                0 (i)
                 42 CALL                     1
                 50 POP_TOP
                 52 JUMP_BACKWARD           15 (to 24)

      2     >>   54 END_FOR
                 56 RETURN_CONST             0 (None)

### Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

Sometimes you can write code that seems perfectly efficient, but is actually much slower than it needs to be. For example, take a look at this function:

```python
def inefficient_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total
```

It doesn't use the Python built-in functions, but there's nothing obviously wrong with it. And it's _not_ wrong, but let's look at the bytecode.

```python
print(dis.dis(inefficient_sum))
```

      1           0 RESUME                   0

      2           2 LOAD_CONST               1 (0)
                  4 STORE_FAST               1 (total)

      3           6 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (NULL + range)
                 16 LOAD_FAST                0 (n)
                 18 CALL                     1
                 26 GET_ITER
            >>   28 FOR_ITER                 7 (to 46)
                 32 STORE_FAST               2 (i)

      4          34 LOAD_FAST                1 (total)
                 36 LOAD_FAST                2 (i)
                 38 BINARY_OP               13 (+=)
                 42 STORE_FAST               1 (total)
                 44 JUMP_BACKWARD            9 (to 28)

      3     >>   46 END_FOR

      5          48 LOAD_FAST                1 (total)
                 50 RETURN_VALUE
    None

Without getting lost in the details, the thing to notice is that there are a fair amount of instructions. Let's compare this to a more efficient version where we use the Python built-in operations.

```python
def efficient_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

print(dis.dis(efficient_sum))
```

      1           0 RESUME                   0

      2           2 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (NULL + sum)
                 12 LOAD_GLOBAL              3 (NULL + range)
                 22 LOAD_FAST                0 (n)
                 24 CALL                     1
                 32 CALL                     1
                 40 RETURN_VALUE
    None

The first thing you'll notice is that the bytecode for `efficient_sum` is much simpler, which is a sign that it's probably a much more efficient operation. It's also good to look at the type of operation, as some operations are more costly than others.

```python
%timeit inefficient_sum(10)
```

    116 ns ± 1.22 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)

```python
%timeit efficient_sum(10)
```

    89.7 ns ± 0.628 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)

```python
%timeit inefficient_sum(100)
```

    1.13 μs ± 7.52 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)

```python
%timeit efficient_sum(100)
```

    384 ns ± 2.54 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)

That's a significant difference. And it becomes more significant the more numbers you are summing.

### External Functions

You can also use `dis` on imported functions. Here is an example with `requests.get`:

```python
import requests

dis.dis(requests.get)
```

     62           0 RESUME                   0

     73           2 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (NULL + request)
                 12 LOAD_CONST               1 ('get')
                 14 LOAD_FAST                0 (url)
                 16 BUILD_TUPLE              2
                 18 LOAD_CONST               2 ('params')
                 20 LOAD_FAST                1 (params)
                 22 BUILD_MAP                1
                 24 LOAD_FAST                2 (kwargs)
                 26 DICT_MERGE               1
                 28 CALL_FUNCTION_EX         1
                 30 RETURN_VALUE

##### Limitations

Unfortunately, `dis` cannot do everything. In particular, it can only work for functions that are implemented in Python. Many libraries, such as NumPy and PyTorch, have functions written in C or C++. This means that `dis` will throw an error if you try to use it on them.

```python
import math
import numpy as np
```

```python
try:
    dis.dis(math.sqrt)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

    Error: don't know how to disassemble builtin_function_or_method objects

```python
try:
    dis.dis(np.sqrt)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

    Error: don't know how to disassemble ufunc objects

In these cases, you can still time the functions. This is how I learned that `math.sqrt` is around an order of magnitude faster than `np.sqrt`, which surprised me. I would have thought `np.sqrt` would be faster.

```python
%timeit [math.sqrt(n) for n in range(100)]
```

    2.59 μs ± 9.01 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)

```python
%timeit [np.sqrt(n) for n in range(100)]
```

    40.7 μs ± 582 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
