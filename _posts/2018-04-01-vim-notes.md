The following is my handy post for vim notes, tips, and tricks.

## Tutor

Simply type `vimtutor` into the terminal to open up the tutor. Go through it a few times until it becomes familiar.

## Basic Commands

* `u` - undo
* `U` - undo all changes on a line
* `Ctrl + r` - redo

Note that `u` and undo `U`

## Basic Movements

* `hjkl` - move around like cursors
* `w` - start of next word
* `e` - end of the word
* `b` - beginning of the word (sort of like the opposite of `w`)
* `gg` - beginning of file
* `G` - end of file
* `3w` - move 3 words
* `3igo` - write the word "go" three times



* `fo` - find next "o"


* `3fq` - find third instance of "q"

* `%` - jump from a { to a } or ( to a )

* `0` - beginning of line
* `$` - end of line
* `*` - find the next instance of the word under the cursor
* `#` - find the previous instance of the word under the cursor

* `2G` - go to line 2

Often, you can use shift to do the reverse of what you were trying to do:

* `n` - next
* `N` - previous

* `O` - insert new line above (The letter `O`, not the number `0`)
* `o` - insert new line below


* `x` - delete character under cursor
* `X` - delete character to the left of the cursor

* `A` - append to end of line

* `r` - replace single character without switching to insert mode

* `d` - delete
* `dw` - delete first word on right side of cursor
* `d$` - delete to the end of the line
* `p` - print the deleted word

* `d2e` - delete two words?
* `.` - keep deleting

* `v` - visual mode

show line numbers - `set number` (or `set nu` for short)

## Operator and Motion

Motions:
 * `w` - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
 *  `e` - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
 *  `$` - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

Typing a number before a motion means it repeats that many times.

## Change

Using `c` to change text automatically puts you in insert mode.

* `ce` - change to end of word
* `c$` - change to end of line
* `cc` - delete entire line

Operator number motion

## Searching for Text

To find a word in Vim, simply type `/` or `?`

## Debugging
* set breakpoint: `158 b`

Explore - lets you look at other files; navigate the file structure



`ls` to see multiple files open in vim

## Copy and Paste
`yy` to yank one line
`p` to paste

So in a lot of ways `yy` is like `dd`

## Cursor and File Status

* `Ctrl + g` to get file info

## Find and Replace
First, you'll need to change your username
* `:%s/jsimonelli/yourusernamehere/g`

To get confirmation before you make each change:
* `:%s/old/new/gc`

Then, your folder path

If you're in data ops, it would be
* `:%s/orig_path1\/orig_path2\/orig_path3/new_path1\/new_path1/g`

If you're in computer vision, it would be
* `:%s/orig_word/new_word/g`

Substitute:
* `g` means global (change every case, not just the first)
* `%` means all lines

* `:%s/username/[NAME]/g`

## Running External Commands

* Type `:` to get the cursor to the bottom of the screen.
* Type `!` then the command. For example `!ls`

## In VSCode

use `kj` to enter vim mode in vscode

## Configuring Defaults

Edit your `.vimrc` file in your home directory.

For example, you can add `set number` here to always show the line numbers.

# Adding Vim Keybindings Everywhere

Add them to your terminal:

* Open `~/.zshrc`
* Add `bindkey -v`
* To enable backspace in insert mode, add `bindkey '^?' backward-delete-char`
