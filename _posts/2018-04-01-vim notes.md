## Tutor

Simply type `vimtutor` into the terminal to open up the tutor. Go through it a few times until it becomes familiar

* u - undo

## Basic Movements
`hjkl` - move around like cursors
* `w` - start of next word
* `e` - end of the word
* b - beginning of the word
* G - end of file
* 3w - move 3 words

`3igo` - write the word "go" three times


To find a word in Vi/Vim, simply type the / or ? key

* `fo` - find next "o"


* `3fq` - find third instance of "q"

* `%` - jump from a { to a } or ( to a )

* `0` - beginning of line
* `%`` - end of line
* `*` - find the next instance of the word under the cursor
* `#` - find the previous instance of the word under the cursor

* 2G - go to line 2

searching for text:
/

Often, you can use shift to do the reverse of what you were trying to do:

* `n` - next
* `N` - previous

* `O` - insert new line above
* `o` - insert new line below


* `x` - delete character under cursor
* `X` - delete character to the left of cursor

* `a` - append to end of line

* `r` - replace single character without switching to insert mode

* `d` - delete
* `dw` - delete first word on right side of cursor
* `p` - print the deleted word

* `d2e` - delete two words?
* `.` - keep deleting

* `v` - visual mode

show line numbers - set number (or set nu for short)
or, to do it by default: Add set number to your .vimrc file in your home directory.

## Debugging
* set breakpoint: `158 b`

Explore - lets you look at other files; navigate the file structure



ls to see multiple files open in vim

## Copy and Paste
`yy` to yank one line
`p` to paste


replace a section
First, you'll need to change your username
:%s/jsimonelli/yourusernamehere/g

Then, your folder path

If you're in data ops, it would be
:%s/orig_path1\/orig_path2\/orig_path3/new_path1\/new_path1/g

If you're in computer vision, it would be
:%s/orig_word/new_word/g

Substitute:
`g` means global (change every case, not just the first)
`%` means all lines

:%s/username/[NAME]/g


## In VSCode

use kj to enter vim mode in vscode
