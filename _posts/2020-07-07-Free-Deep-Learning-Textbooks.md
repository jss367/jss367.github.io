There are a lot of great resources out there so I thought I would try to compile some of my favorites. This list contains books on deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision. These textbooks are all made freely available by the publisher.

## Deep Learning

[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf) (2020) - Official textbook from the PyTorch team.

* [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (2015) - The most popular textbook in deep learning. Free in HTML form. There's not a PDF that you can simply download.

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) (2015) - This is also a book where there is no PDF of it. There are JavaScript elements in the text so it wouldn't work as well in PDF form anyway.

* [First Contact With Deep Learning: Practical Introduction With Keras by Jordi Torres](https://torres.ai/first-contact-deep-learning-practical-introduction-keras/) (2018)

## General Machine Learning

* [Machine Learning Yearning by Andrew Ng](https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/) (2018) - this is more about the machine learning process and how to build projects. It's a short read. You have to provide an email address to download it. And while you're there I would recommend leaving the check box for signing up to receive his newsletter, The Batch, checked as well because it's a very good resource.

* [Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable by Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) (2020)

## Computer Vision

* [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications by Richard Szeliski](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf) (2010) - The latest edition was published in 2010, so it predates the deep learning revolution.
