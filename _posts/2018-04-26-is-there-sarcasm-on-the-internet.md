Is there sarcasm on the Internet? OK, that's an easy one. Here's a more difficult question: can an AI be trained to detect that sarcasm? The first step to training that algorithm would be to create a corpus of sarcastic statements from the Internet. Fortunately, there's a lot of sarcasm out there and, even more fortunately, much of it is already labeled.

 Both Reddit and Twitter have mechanisms where users can self-label a statement as sarcastic. On Reddit, users can end their statement with " /s" to denote sarcasm, such as: "That's a good idea /s". For Tweets, the #sarcasm hashtag is popular: "That's a good idea #sarcasm". Both of these forms of self-labeling make them a prime target to be used in a machine learning algorithm. In this notebook, I'm going to show how to scrape Reddit data and extract sarcastic statements.

The most popular way to scrape Reddit from Python is with [PRAW: the Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The first step is to download it.  Note that you can do so inside a Jupyter Notebook with the command: `!pip install praw`.

Reddit's API is easy to use and quick to sign up for. You will need a Reddit account. After you have an account, you will need to go to their [applications page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and click on "create another app..." on the bottom left. Then enter a name for your application. Note the per the [Reddit API rules](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api) you cannot use the word "reddit" in the title unless you have the word "for" preceding it. E.g. "scraper for reddit" is allowed but "reddit scraper" isn't. The rest of the application can be completed as follows:

* name: scraper
* [click on the "script" checkbox]
* description: A simple application for scraping data
* about url:
* redirect uri: http://localhost:8080  [see the praw documentation for more information]

You will get a 14-character personal use script and a 27-character secret key. You will need them to authenticate with Reddit.


```python
import praw
import re
```


If you are only collecting public comments, you won't need to include your username and password. If you are trying to access anything from your own account you will need to add it to the call below.


```python
data = praw.Reddit(client_id=my_client_id,
                  client_secret=my_client_secret,
                  user_agent='scraper')
```

Let's look in the AskReddit subreddit.


```python
subreddit  = data.subreddit("AskReddit")
```

Now we can look at the most popular threads on AskReddit.


```python
for submission in subreddit.top(limit=50):
    print(submission.title)
```

Now let's extract the ones with the sarcasm marker " /s"


```python
list_of_comments = []
# This takes a while to go through all the child comments
submission.comments.replace_more(limit=10)
for top_level_comment in submission.comments:
    list_of_comments.append(top_level_comment.body)
```


```python
for comment in list_of_comments:
    has_sarcasm = re.search(' \/s', comment)
    if has_sarcasm:
        print(comment)
        print("\n\n\n")
```

    Syrian, we have this little conflict going on, nothing too big /s 
    
    
    
    
    

This works, but it would take quite a lot to scrape enough data to have a sufficient dataset. Fortunately, much of the scraping has already been done. Someone has already scraped and made available [Reddit comments dating back to December 2005](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/).

After doing this, I realized that someone had already gone through that data and extracted sarcastic statements from it. They also created the largest corpus of sarcastic statements, containing 1.3 million examples, which they call the [Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC)](https://github.com/NLPrinceton/SARC). To read more about their corpus or to see their baseline detection rates, see their paper, *[A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sarcasm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05579.pdf).*
