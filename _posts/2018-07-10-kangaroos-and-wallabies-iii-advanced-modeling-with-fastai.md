In this notebook, we're going to take the [dataset we prepared] and continue to iterate on the modeling. Last time [we built a model using TensorFlow and Xception](https://jss367.github.io/kangaroos-and-wallabies-ii-building-a-model.html). This time, we're going to iterate on that using [FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).

> Note: This notebook has been rewritten since FastAI has changed so much. See below for the most recent version it was run with.


```python
import fastai
from fastai.data.all import *
from fastai.vision.all import *
```


```python
fastai.__version__
```




    '2.5.3'



First, we need to create a `DataBlock`. Please see my [FastAI Data Tutorial - Image Classification](https://jss367.github.io/fastai-data-tutorial-image-classification.html) for details on this process.


```python
dblock = DataBlock(blocks    = (ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),
                   get_items = get_image_files,
                   get_y     = parent_label,
                   splitter  = GrandparentSplitter('train', 'val'),
                   item_tfms = Resize(224))
```

We need to point to the image root path.


```python
if sys.platform == 'linux':
    path = Path(r'/home/julius/data/WallabiesAndRoosFullSize')
else:
    path = Path(r'E:/Data/Raw/WallabiesAndRoosFullSize')
```


```python
dls = dblock.dataloaders(path)
```

Letâ€™s see how many items we have in each set.


```python
len(dls.train.items), len(dls.valid.items)
```




    (3653, 567)



Let's look at some example images to make sure everything is correct.


```python
dls.train.show_batch(max_n=4, nrows=1)
```

FastAI provides some standard transforms that work quite well, so we'll use them.


```python
dblock = dblock.new(item_tfms=Resize(128, ResizeMethod.Pad, pad_mode='zeros'), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(mult=2))
dls = dblock.dataloaders(path)
dls.valid.show_batch(max_n=4, nrows=1)
```

    torch.linalg.solve has its arguments reversed and does not return the LU factorization.
    To get the LU factorization see torch.lu, which can be used with torch.lu_solve or torch.lu_unpack.

```python
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)

The `error_rate` pertains to the validation set, showing that we got about 91%. Let's look at a confusion matrix.


```python
interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)
interp.plot_confusion_matrix()
```
