In this series of posts, I will show how to build an image classifier using your own dataset. I'll be using images of kangaroos and wallabies that I've taken, but these techniques should work well with any kind of images.

I'm always curious about how people set up their computers and what software packages they have, so I thought I would share mine. I use Windows, Mac, and Linux, so the exact setup varies by operating system. For those of you on Windows, many of these can be installed with [Ninite](https://ninite.com/).

# General

## Text Editors
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* I absolutely love this. Use it every day
* With package control
* Be sure to include the [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing)

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) (Ninite)
* Really good but I just don't use it that much anymore
* Good for long-term memory stuff, storing pictures (like receipts)

## Utilities

### File Management

[Commander One](https://mac.eltima.com/file-manager.html) (Mac only)
* Dual-panel file explorer
* *Much* better than Finder

[Files](https://github.com/files-community/Files) (FOSS, Windows)
* I recently started using this on Windows and like it
* Good use of tabs and windows

[muCommander](https://www.mucommander.com/)
* More lightweight than Commander One, so I'm starting to prefer it
* [This website](https://logicgrimoire.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/richs-quick-and-easy-guide-to-file-management-with-mucommander/) offers good tips on how to get started with it

Still looking for one on Windows that I like

### Searching for files
[Agent Ransack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/) (Windows)
- Perfect search tool. I strongly favor this over the (otherwise also very good) alternatives
- No equivalent for Linux or Mac, although there are decent built-in options

### Screenshots
[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) (FOSS, Windows)
- Good improvement to Windows' default screenshot tool
- For a mac I just use the built-in tool

### Unzipping
[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) (Ninite)
- The clear winner for Windows

### Checking disk space
[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/index.html) (Ninite, Window)

[ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)

## Web Browsers
I always have three or more web browsers on each computer. I use them for different things. All are very good.
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (Ninite)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (Ninite)
* [Brave](https://brave.com/)

### Brower Extensions
* [AdBlockPlus](https://adblockplus.org/)
* [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

## Media
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) (Ninite)
* Seems to have won the music player market for now

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (FOSS, Ninite)

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)


## Cloud Storage

[Google backup and sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/) (Ninite)
* Unlimited photos, very good app
* They keep renaming it, and I expect that to continue. It's Google

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) (Ninite)
* Poor website interface but other than that one of my favorites

[Microsoft OneDrive](https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) (Ninite)
* This does syncing very well

Yes, I do use many different cloud services. All for slightly different purposes.

## Productivity

[Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) (Mac)
* Great app for resizing windows

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (Mac)
* In the running for one of the best productivity apps in existence
* This is probably my favorite app for the Mac
* Can be as simple or complex as you like

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) (FOSS, Mac only)
* Great for remapping keys
* You can [add the best Windows shortcuts to Mac](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=windows) with it
* I use this to make control jump over words
  * Lots of useful things under complex rules

# Programming

## Python Distribution

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (FOSS)
* Now a no-brainer for data scientists

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Ninite)
* Right now it's VSCode and I'm very happy with it. I have used many of the alternatives and, in general, I think there are a lot of good options, but I like VSCode.
* Configuring your IDE that way you like it is essential, and VSCode is incredibly extensible.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* Honorable mention
* I used to use this but since VSCode has improved its remote support so much I haven't gone back
* It is excellent though and I recommend it

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)
* The clear winner in my opinion for R IDE, although I don't use R much anymore so this could no longer be true

## Version Control
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* I think git has by-and-large won the version control market
* Used in partnership with [Github](https://github.com/)
* Git is great but frustrating when you [can't figure it out](https://xkcd.com/1597/) (yes, I've done this)
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is amazing and makes git much more beginner-friendly
  * I also recommend the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)

# Terminals

## Mac

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* The clear winner for Mac and my overall favorite. I wish Linux and Windows had this

## Windows

In Windows, I use a mix, mostly because none of them are perfect. Here's a case (unlike browsers) that I would rather just have one

[Cmder](https://cmder.net/)
* Allows Unix style commands, makes switching between Mac and Linux and Windows much easier

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
* A top contender for the best terminal in Windows. This is a really good terminal

[Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7)
* Sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't...

[Anaconda Prompt](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* I only use this for Anaconda stuff

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install)
* Promising, definite promising. Keep working on it Microsoft!

[Ubuntu terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview)
* Still a work in progress. Gets better all the time but still has room for improvement.

As you can see, I'm strewn across half a dozen terminals in Windows and have found the one on Mac. For me, nothing beats iTerm2.

## Linux
[Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
* Favorite for Linux at the moment

# Shells
[Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
* Default on Mac now
* Manage it with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* You can also [install it on Windows](https://winsmarts.com/running-oh-my-zsh-on-windows-10-6fcb0fbc736b)
* Overall, I like it. Easy to customize

Here is [my recommended usage](https://jss367.github.io/blog/bash-aliases/).

# Office Suite
[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
* Don't love it, but great for sharing and multi-person editing

[Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
* I prefer Excel, but it's free and I don't use spreadsheets enough to buy Excel

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)
* I prefer this to Google's offerings but I don't use this very much anymore.

# Security

## Malware Protection

I have no loyalty to any of these. I usually just go with the top free one recommended. I've also used paid ones in the past but I don't know if it's worth it.

[Malware Bytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (Ninite)

## Password Managers

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
* I feel like I've finally found the password manager that I've been looking for. Does what I want without being obnoxious

Honorable mentions:
* [KeePass 2](https://keepass.info/) (FOSS, Ninite)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) (paid) - Lots of features but can be very annoying. Not good at interpreting input fields

## Managing Updates

[Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com/home-updater-download) (Windows only)
* I'm still looking for something to help me automatically update software on my computer. So far I've gone with patch my pc but there's nothing I like


## Messaging

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (Ninite)

[Slack](https://slack.com/)
* I can't believe this took so long to be invented. This is how communication should be

[Viber](https://www.viber.com/)
* Beware: has ads, though I don't find them particularly intrusive

# Databases

[Navicat for PostgreSQL](https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-postgresql)
* Not free but this is my favorite for databases

[Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Free and feels like VSCode in many ways
* FOSS alternative to Navicat for PostgreSQL for me

[Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) (Mac only)
* Not free but still very good


# LaTeX Editor

[Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
* Requires a distribution with it. I like MIKTEX
* I also recommend pdflatex (through miktex)

# Hex Editor
* [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) (Windows only)

* For Mac I'm trying out [Hex Fiend](https://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/)


# Video Conferencing

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (Ninite)

[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)

# Photography

[Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)
* As much as I'd like to say [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/ ) is just as good, it's no match for the features of Lightroom. For someone who spends serious time editing photos, I don't think there's a better alternative.

[Image Composite Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/image-composite-editor/)
* Free tool from Microsoft to stitch images for panoramas. Works better than Lightroom

[StarStaX](https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/)
* Great for making star trails
* A really nice simple piece of software that does one thing well

[ISS Transit Finder](https://transit-finder.com/)
* Online only, no download

# Other

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* Pretty good. I hope it keeps getting better as natural language processing improves

[Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) (Ninite)

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

[Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) (Windows only)

[Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/astronomy-picture-of-the-day/9wzdncrfj1xh?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
* Get beautiful backgrounds every day

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Still a pain on Windows Home. Wonderful for Linux and Mac

[Wget for Windows](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/)
* just stick in somewhere in your path, C:\Windows

[Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) (Ninite)
* For reading pdfs
* I mainly just my web browser now

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (FOSS)
* The clear winner for free network protocol analyzers

[Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/)
* Cloud-hosted logging

[Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) (FOSS, Mac)

[gpustat](https://github.com/wookayin/gpustat)
* Very nice tool to tracking GPU usage
* Includes which user is user the GPU, significant upgrade to `nvidia-smi`

## Research

[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/)
* The best app for keeping track of scientific papers
* Definitely use the browser extensions as well


## Evaluating

[Belarc Advisor](https://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor)
* Similar to Speccy

[Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) (Windows)

[PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) (Windows)

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
* Seems good so far, although the free version doesn't work for private repos.

[CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)

[HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch)

[Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox) (Windows, FOSS)
* Like Alfred for Windows
* Default is Alt + Spacebar, which is a little different on the keyboard than Alfred.


# Customizations

## Sublime

#### Tabs

I don't like the way Sublime handles tabs, so I change it to make it more like Chrome. To do this, you'll need to edit your key bindings. Here's how you do that:

(Windows) Preferences -> Key Bindings

Then add this to the file:

{ "keys": ["ctrl+tab"], "command": "next_view" },
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+tab"], "command": "prev_view" }

#### Markdown Files

I don't particularly like the way Sublime handles markdown files by default, so I go into Preferences -> Settings -> Syntax Specific (Mac) and add this:
```
{
	"color_scheme": "Monokai.sublime-color-scheme",
	"draw_centered": false,
	"line_numbers": true,
	"gutter": true,
}
```
Here's another option:
```
{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/Monokai Extended/Monokai Extended.tmTheme",
	"dictionary": "Packages/Language - English/en_US.dic",
	"ignored_packages":
	[
		"Markdown",
		"Vintage"
	],
	"line_numbers": true,
	"show_full_path": true,
	"spell_check": true,
	"theme": "Adaptive.sublime-theme"
}
```
I always install these extensions:
* [Monokai Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended)
* [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended)

For theme I do adaptive

Color scheme is monokai-extended

You'll want to make sure you used markdown-extended:
View -> Syntax -> Markdown Extended
but this only applies it to one file.

# Decommissioned

These are apps I used to use but for one reason or another don't anymore. I thought I'd keep them here as honorable mentions.

## Text Editors

[Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Ninite)
* Honorable mention but almost completely replaced by Sublime Text

[Atom](https://atom.io/)
* I've used this but prefer the others, so rarely go back to it

#### Editting Markdown

[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
* I've recently started using this and like it so far.
* I don't like how it defaults to asking you to name a file for a new file but you can turn that off in the preferences

[Mark Text](https://marktext.app/)
* Here's the other one I use a lot. I recommend them both, about equally.

## Malware Protection

[Avast](https://www.avast.com/en-us/index#pc) (Ninite)
* The free version has so many obnoxious popups it's basically adware. So you install adware to avoid malware, most of which is adware... I guess I'm supposed to buy the paid version. It's hard to know how good your anti-virus software is.

## VPN

[Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/)
* I do not have a favorite VPN and I've tried many, both paid and free.

Mozilla also released a VPN that I've started using a bit

## Cloud Storage
[Pcloud Drive](https://www.pcloud.com/download-free-online-cloud-file-storage.html)
* Not as good as the others so I stopped using it as much

## New Tab Page
https://start.me/
