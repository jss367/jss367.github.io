I’m always curious about how people set up their computers and what software packages they have, so I thought I would share mine. So you know where I’m coming from, I use Windows, Mac, and Linux nearly every day. Part of my goal is to make transitioning between these systems as seamless as possible, but the exact setup varies by the operating system. For those of you on Windows, many of these can be installed with [Ninite](https://ninite.com/). I do a pretty good job of keeping this list up-to-date, so it should reflect my current recommendations for software.

<b>Table of Contents</b>
* TOC
{:toc}


# Writing

## Text Editors
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* I absolutely love this. Use it every day
* With package control
* Be sure to include the [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing)

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) (Ninite)
* Really good but I just don't use it that much anymore
* Good for long-term memory stuff, storing pictures (like receipts)

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop)
* Great for note-taking

## Office Suite

[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
* Don't love it, but great for sharing and multi-person editing

[Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
* I prefer Excel, but it's free and I don't use spreadsheets enough to buy Excel

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)
* I prefer cloud-based editors so I don't use this very much anymore.

## LaTeX Editor

[Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
* Requires a distribution with it. I like MIKTEX
* I also recommend pdflatex (through miktex)

## Spelling and Grammar

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* Very good. I hope it keeps getting better as natural language processing improves

# Utilities

## File Explorer

[Commander One](https://mac.eltima.com/file-manager.html) (Mac only)
* Dual-panel file explorer
* *Much* better than Finder

[Path Finder](https://cocoatech.com/) (Mac only)
* Dual-panel file explorer
* Might become my new file explorer for Mac
* You might need to customize the hot keys

![png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/path_finder_options.png)

[Files](https://github.com/files-community/Files) (FOSS, Windows)
* I recently started using this on Windows and like it
* Good use of tabs and windows

## File Search
[Agent Ransack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/) (Windows)
- Perfect search tool. I strongly favor this over the (otherwise also very good) alternatives
- No equivalent for Linux or Mac, although there are decent built-in options

## Screenshots
[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) (FOSS, Windows)
- This is a perfect screenshot tool. It does everything I want

For a mac I just use the built-in tool
- Note that if you want to select just a part of your screen, you should use `command + shift + 4`, then if you want to copy it straight to your clipboard (so you can paste it), hold `control` while you draw the outline

## Package Managers
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac)
* By far the best package manager for MacOS

## Unzipping
[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) (Ninite)
- The clear winner for Windows

## Checking disk space
[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/index.html) (Ninite, Window)

[ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)

# Web Browsers
I always have three or more web browsers on each computer. I use them for different things. All are very good.
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (Ninite)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (Ninite)
* [Brave](https://brave.com/)

## Browser Extensions
* [AdBlockPlus](https://adblockplus.org/)
* [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
* [JSON Fomatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa)

## New Tab Page
[Start.me](https://start.me/)

# Programming

## Python Distribution

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (FOSS)
* Now a no-brainer for data scientists

## Python Package Manager

[uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/)
* Now the best package manager
* Extremely fast and easy-to-use

[Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)
* This is a superior package manager to conda

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Ninite)
* Right now it's VSCode and I'm very happy with it. I have used many of the alternatives and, in general, I think there are a lot of good options, but I like VSCode.
* Configuring your IDE that way you like it is essential, and VSCode is incredibly extensible.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)
* The clear winner in my opinion for R IDE, although I don't use R much anymore so this could no longer be true

## Version Control
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* git has by-and-large won the version control market
* Used in partnership with [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* Git is great but frustrating when you [can't figure it out](https://xkcd.com/1597/) (yes, I've done this)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is amazing and makes git much more beginner-friendly
  * I also recommend the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)
  * GitHub Desktop also has a [version for Linux](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop) that I use

## Hex Editor
* [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) (Windows only)

* For Mac I'm trying out [Hex Fiend](https://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/)

# Media
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) (Ninite)
* Seems to have won the music player market for now

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (FOSS, Ninite)

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)


# Cloud Storage

[Google backup and sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/) (Ninite)
* Unlimited photos, very good app
* They keep renaming it, and I expect that to continue. It's Google

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) (Ninite)
* Poor website interface but other than that one of my favorites

[Microsoft OneDrive](https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) (Ninite)
* This does syncing very well

Yes, I do use many different cloud services. All for slightly different purposes.

# Productivity

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) (FOSS, Mac only)
* Makes moving and resizing windows easy on a Mac
* Here are the default hot keys

![png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/rectangle_defaults.png)

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (Mac only)
* In the running for one of the best productivity apps in existence
* This is probably my favorite app for the Mac
* Can be as simple or complex as you like
* `cmd + option + c` to open clipboard history

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

## Make macOS more like Windows

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) (FOSS, Mac only)
* Great for remapping keys
* See my [software customizations](https://jss367.github.io/software-customizations.html#karabiner-elements) for how I set it up

Usually the apps you need to give permissions to pop up in the list when you look for them, but not everything for Karabiner did for me. So I had to click the plus sign and go find whatever was missing.

[Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) (FOSS, Mac)
* Here's how I set mine up

<img width="394" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3067731/192405163-11a1a60c-655a-49f4-86cd-260062c66d0d.png">

[Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/)
* Switch between applications more like Windows

# Terminals

## Mac

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* The clear winner for Mac and my overall favorite. I wish Linux and Windows had this

## Windows

In Windows, I use a mix, mostly because none of them are perfect. Here's a case (unlike browsers) that I would rather just have one

[Cmder](https://cmder.net/)
* Allows Unix style commands, makes switching between Mac and Linux and Windows much easier

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
* A top contender for the best terminal in Windows. This is a really good terminal

[Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7)
* Sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't...

[Anaconda Prompt](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* I only use this for Anaconda stuff

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* Promising, definite promising. Keep working on it Microsoft!

[Ubuntu terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview)
* Still a work in progress. Gets better all the time but still has room for improvement.
* Update: This has gotten much better. I'm now using this with zsh like I do on my Mac and am liking it a lot.

As you can see, I'm strewn across half a dozen terminals in Windows and have found the one on Mac. For me, nothing beats iTerm2.

## Linux

[Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
* Favorite for Linux at the moment

# Shells

[Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
* Default on Mac now
* Manage it with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* You can also [install it on Windows](https://winsmarts.com/running-oh-my-zsh-on-windows-10-6fcb0fbc736b)
* Overall, I like it. Easy to customize
* Also [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) is great

## Terminal Add-ons
[Pygments](https://pygments.org/)
* Syntax highlighter
* I use it so often I alias it to the letter "c"
* it's like `cat` but with colors

[Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)
* This is the best way to get around a Unix terminal

[Glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/)
* A great system monitoring tools
* Works across all platforms

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

You can also find a lot of great tools here: https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix

# Security

## Malware Protection

I have no loyalty to any of these. I usually just go with the top free one recommended. I've also used paid ones in the past but I don't know if it's worth it.

[Malware Bytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (Ninite)

## Password Managers

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
* I feel like I've finally found the password manager that I've been looking for. Does what I want without being obnoxious

## Managing Updates

[Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com/home-updater-download) (Windows only)
* I'm still looking for something to help me automatically update software on my computer. So far I've gone with patch my pc but there's nothing I like

# Social

## Messaging

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (Ninite)

[Slack](https://slack.com/)
* I can't believe this took so long to be invented. This is how communication should be

[Viber](https://www.viber.com/)
* Beware: has ads, though I don't find them particularly intrusive

## Video Conferencing

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (Ninite)

[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)

## Online Get Togethers

[Gather](https://www.gather.town/)

# Databases

[DataGrip](jetbrains.com/datagrip/)

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) (FOSS)
* My current favorite open source database software

# Images

## Image Viewer
[Xee](https://theunarchiver.com/xee) (Mac)
* I make this my default image viewer
  * To do so, right click an image file type in your window viewer (Command One in my case) and hold down `option` so "Get Info" turns into "Get Finder Info". Then you can expand "Open with" and select your image viewer of choice.

You'll have to go into preferences to change the way to scroll left and right.

## Image Editing
[Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) (Windows, Mac)
* As much as I'd like to say GIMP is just as good, it's no match for the features of Lightroom. For someone who spends serious time editing photos, I don't think there's a better alternative.

[Paintbrush](https://paintbrush.sourceforge.io/) (FOSS, Mac only)
* Simple image editing on Mac

## Photography

[Image Composite Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/image-composite-editor/)
* Free tool from Microsoft to stitch images for panoramas. Works better than Lightroom

[StarStaX](https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/)
* Great for making star trails
* A really nice simple piece of software that does one thing well

[ISS Transit Finder](https://transit-finder.com/)
* Online only, no download

Static Type Checker - mypy
* I put my mypy config in ~/.mypy.ini

# Honorable Mentions

There are applications that were either neck-and-neck with other ones, or I use very infrequently, or I used to use but no longer do. I generally still think they're worth checking out.

[Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Free and feels like VSCode in many ways
* FOSS alternative to Navicat for PostgreSQL for me

[Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) (Mac only)
* Not free but still very good

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)  (Linux)
* The Paint program I like on Windows doesn't exist for Linux, so I use GIMP instead.

[Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox) (Windows, FOSS)
* Like Alfred for Windows
* Default is Alt + Spacebar, which is a little different on the keyboard than Alfred.

[CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)

[HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch)

[Navicat for PostgreSQL](https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-postgresql)
* Not free but this is my favorite for databases

[muCommander](https://www.mucommander.com/)
* More lightweight than Commander One, so I sometimes use it
* [This website](https://logicgrimoire.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/richs-quick-and-easy-guide-to-file-management-with-mucommander/) offers good tips on how to get started with it
