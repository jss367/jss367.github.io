A short walk around the Adelaide CBD was enough to start me wondering if Adelaide's climate wasn't better than that of Alice Springs. It seemed that no matter the time of year, the weather in Adelaide was much nicer than Alice. I grabbed some climate data from Wikipedia, and after a couple of graphs, my suspicion was confirmed: If Alice Springs and Adelaide had a baby that was exactly like Adelaide in every way, it would be a great place.

Adelaide stays nice in the summer while Alice gets blisteringly hot.

Yet it manages to stay warmer in the winter months. I definitely moved to the wrong city.
