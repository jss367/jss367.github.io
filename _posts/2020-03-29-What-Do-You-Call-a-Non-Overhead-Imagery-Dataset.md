title: "What Do You Call a Non-Overhead Imagery Dataset?"
tags: [Geospatial Analytics]

What do you call a dataset of non-overhead images like ImageNet? Is it a "normal" imagery dataset? The group that made the [xView dataset](http://xviewdataset.org/) used the terms "natural and overhead imagery" to describe the two dataset types[^1]. Ground-based imagery? This sounds too much like ground-based radar, and no one is going to think this term refers to ordinary selfies and cat pictures. So what's the term?

This is kind of like the question of what do you call a non-smartphone? A dumb phone? Wikipedia calls it a "Feature phone"[^2] but I've never heard anyone use that term. A dumb phone? People would know what you're talking about but would you use this in a professional setting? Would you just say "non-smart phone"? Again, people will understand but it sounds awkward.
