I found that the US Census API is difficult to work with and even LLMs don't provide working code for it. So I thought it might be helpful to share some techniques that did work. In this post, I'm going to focus on both raw API calls and the Python wrapper.

<b>Table of Contents</b>

## API key


```python
import os

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import requests
from census import Census
```

You need to get an API key. Fortunately, this part is really easy—all you need to do is sign up on [their website](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).


```python
API_KEY = os.getenv('CENSUS_API_KEY')
```

There are different ways to access the census data, including through their website, through direct API calls, and through a Python wrapper.

## Understanding Tables

Here, we'll use a different table. You can see the different tables here: https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/groups/

In the census data, you'll also see IDs like `B19013A_001E`. Let's take a moment to understand what it means. It's in the following format:

`[TABLE_ID][SUBGROUP]_[LINE][SUFFIX]`

So, in this case:
* `B19013A` is the **table id**. This specific table is titled "Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2021 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars)". 
* `001` refers to the **line number** within that table, corresponding to a specific row (e.g., "Median household income").
* `E` stands for **Estimate** — as opposed to M, which would be the Margin of Error for that estimate.

One table with a lot of data is S0201. S0201 refers to the Selected Population Profile (SPP) table series. This is used for detailed demographic, social, economic, and housing data by race, Hispanic origin, tribal group, or ancestry.

## Direct API Calls

We're going to look at the American Community Survey (ACS) Select Population Profiles (SPP) data.

You need to provide `fields` and `iteration codes`. You can find which population is associated with which iteration code here: [https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/datasets/summary-file-2/attachment.pdf](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/datasets/summary-file-2/attachment.pdf)

For fields, we're using `S0201_214E`. S0201 is the table and _214 is the line number within the S0201 table, which corresponds to a specific data item. This is how we can get median household income.

For example, it tells you that `013` is the iteration code for Asian Indians.


```python
YEAR     = 2022  # latest year that I could find that had everything I was looking for
DATASET  = f"https://api.census.gov/data/{YEAR}/acs/acs1/spp"
FIELDS   = "NAME,S0201_214E"                             # median household income
POP_CODE = "013"                                         # <-- Asian Indian alone
URL      = (f"{DATASET}?get={FIELDS}"
            f"&for=us:1&POPGROUP={POP_CODE}&key={API_KEY}")

resp = requests.get(URL, timeout=30)
rows = resp.json()
```


```python
print(resp.status_code)
print(resp.text[:500])
```

    200
    [["NAME","S0201_214E","POPGROUP","us"],
    ["United States","152341","013","1"]]



```python
df = pd.DataFrame(rows[1:], columns=rows[0])
df["S0201_214E"] = pd.to_numeric(df["S0201_214E"])
print("Median HH income (Asian-Indian-American, 2022):",
      f"${int(df.at[0,'S0201_214E']):,}")
```

    Median HH income (Asian-Indian-American, 2022): $152,341


### Verifying Results

It's good to have a way to verify the data as well. For example, you can verify some of the results simply by Googling the number and making sure that's what other people got. By Googling $152,341 you can see other newsites that use the same value and describe it as Indian annual median household [income]((https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-editorial/indian-high-earners-of-the-world-unite/articleshow/109112116.cms?from=mdr)).

## Getting More Data

OK, so we can get a single data point from a query, but it's inefficient to do that for lots of data. Let's grab data for multiple groups in a single request.

Here we also need a field. We're going to use `S0201_214E`. You can see on the [SPP variables table](https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/spp/variables.xml) that `S0201_214E` corresponds to "Median household income (dollars)".


```python
YEAR     = 2022
DATASET  = f"https://api.census.gov/data/{YEAR}/acs/acs1/spp"
FIELDS   = "NAME,S0201_214E,POPGROUP"  # median household income + population group
URL      = (f"{DATASET}?get={FIELDS}"
            f"&for=us:1&key={API_KEY}")
resp = requests.get(URL, timeout=30)
rows = resp.json()

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
income_df = pd.DataFrame(rows[1:], columns=rows[0])
income_df['S0201_214E'] = pd.to_numeric(income_df['S0201_214E'], errors='coerce')
```


```python
len(income_df)
```




    347




```python
income_df.head()
```

## Using the Census Wrapper

There is also a census wrapper you can use that's available for download at [https://pypi.org/project/census/](https://pypi.org/project/census/). Let's use it to get some income data.

Let's look at the `B19013` table. You'll note that not all subgroups are available here. If you want to dig deeper into, say, Asian subgroups, you need to look at a different table.

```
{
  "name": "B19013A",
  "description": "MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2021 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) (WHITE ALONE HOUSEHOLDER)",
  "variables": "http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/groups/B19013A.json",
  "universe ": "Households with a householder who is White alone"
}
```

Now we call the census wrapper.


```python
c = Census(API_KEY)
```


```python
race_data = c.acs5.get(
    ('NAME', 
     'B19013_001E',  # Total population
     'B19013A_001E', # White alone
     'B19013B_001E', # Black alone
     'B19013C_001E', # American Indian/Alaska Native alone
     'B19013D_001E', # Asian alone
     'B19013E_001E', # Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander alone
     'B19013F_001E', # Some other race alone
     'B19013G_001E', # Two or more races
     'B19013H_001E', # White alone, not Hispanic
     'B19013I_001E', # Hispanic/Latino origin (any race)
    ),
    {'for': 'us:*'}
)
```


```python
race_data
```


```python
df = pd.DataFrame(race_data)
df
```

It's... a little ugly. So we can rename the columns.


```python
df = df.rename(columns={
    'B19013_001E': 'Median_Income_Total',
    'B19013A_001E': 'Median_Income_White_Alone',
    'B19013B_001E': 'Median_Income_Black_Alone',
    'B19013C_001E': 'Median_Income_AmIndian_Alone',
    'B19013D_001E': 'Median_Income_Asian_Alone',
    'B19013E_001E': 'Median_Income_Hawaiian_Alone',
    'B19013F_001E': 'Median_Income_Other_Alone',
    'B19013G_001E': 'Median_Income_TwoOrMore',
    'B19013H_001E': 'Median_Income_White_NonHispanic',

## Using the Website

I don't find the website particularly easy to use, either. You can see some of the same information though. Here is the page for the American Community Survey, contains a lot of their data:
* [https://data.census.gov/table?q=American+Community+Survey&t=-A0](https://data.census.gov/table?q=American+Community+Survey&t=-A0)

Here is the ACS data on Asian Indians:
* [https://data.census.gov/table?t=013:Income+and+Poverty&g=010XX00US](https://data.census.gov/table?t=013:Income+and+Poverty&g=010XX00US).

Here's the same for total population:
* [https://data.census.gov/table?t=001:Income+and+Poverty&g=010XX00US](https://data.census.gov/table?t=001:Income+and+Poverty&g=010XX00US)

You can see in the URL how the iteration codes work. You can either change that value directly or use the filters on the left sidebar.

## Errors in the Data

I was surprised to find lots of errors in the data. Here are [a couple of examples](https://x.com/JuliusSimonelli/status/1918827800695292341). Beware, I guess!

## Note on Dates

You might have noticed that I used 2022 in the example above. That's because that's the 2023 (and beyond) data doesn't seem to be there.


```python
YEAR     = 2023 
DATASET  = f"https://api.census.gov/data/{YEAR}/acs/acs1/spp"
FIELDS   = "NAME,S0201_214E"
POP_CODE = "013"
URL      = (f"{DATASET}?get={FIELDS}"
            f"&for=us:1&POPGROUP={POP_CODE}&key={API_KEY}")

empty_resp = requests.get(URL, timeout=30)
```


```python
print(empty_resp.status_code)
print(empty_resp.text[:500])
```

You can see that I got a 204 back, indicating that there was no content returned.
