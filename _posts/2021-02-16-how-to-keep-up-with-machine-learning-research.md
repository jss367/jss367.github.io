It's difficult to keep up with the latest in machine learning, even if it's part of your full-time job. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources out there to help you sort through it all. I thought I would put together a list of resources that I use. If you know of a great resource that I'm missing, please let me know!

## Websites

[Arxiv Sanity](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)

* My #1 place to find new research
* Be sure to create an account and start saving papers you like to it so the recommendation feature can work
* Site created by Andrej Karpathy

[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
* The best site for seeing overall trends in the field
* There's also a newsletter (see below)

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* Start with a paper you're interested in and see who cited it

[ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
* Creates a graph of papers, so you can find research that is similar to what you're looking for
* I love the idea, although I haven't actually used the site much

## Newsletters

I'm not usually a newsletters guy, but for some reason I've found that there are excellent newsletter in the machine learning world. Here are the ones I use:

[The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/)
* Newsletter by Andrew Ng and his company, <deeplearning.ai>
* Offers his thoughts on various hot topics, even if he is unecessarily anodyne. I'd rather him share more of his thoughts
* Includes a mix of general ML news and research findings

[Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/)
* By Jack Clark of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
* Does a great job of highlighting the top papers of the week and gives good context for them as well
* [Subscribe here](https://us13.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=67bd06787e84d73db24fb0aa5&id=6c9d98ff2c)

[The Gradient](https://thegradientpub.substack.com/)
* Lots of good information on recent research

[Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

[Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/)
* One of my favorites

[Wild Week in AI](http://www.wildml.com/newsletter/)

[PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/newsletter/)


## YouTube

[Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew)
* Lots of videos, quite detailed
* Good paper review

[Henry AI Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHB9VepY6kYvZjj0Bgxnpbw)
* Not as popular as some of the others but still really good content

[Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg)
* Hold on to your papers because this guy is great
* Generally shorter videos than the others

[Arxiv Insights](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNIkB2IeJ-6AmZv7bQ1oBYg)
* Not many videos but the ones he has are excellent

## Textbooks

I won't go into textbooks much here, but for more you can check out my [post on deep learning textbooks](https://jss367.github.io/Free-Deep-Learning-Textbooks.html).

## Lectures

You can also find information about the latest research in classes

[Deep Learning for Computer Vision at University of Michigan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r)
* Taught by Justin Johnson, formerly of [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) fame

[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
* The instructor of the courses, Jeremy Howard, sometime references recent research in the lectures


## Twitter

Twitter is probably not the best place, but it can be OK.

[Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg)

[Gwern](https://twitter.com/gwern)

[Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward)

[Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy)

[Tom Silver](https://twitter.com/tomssilver)

[Brundage Bot](https://twitter.com/brundagebot)
* I feel like I should mention this because it posts so often but in reality it doesn't curate enough and posts too many papers for me
* Seems like it stop posting recently

## Blogs

I don't find as many helpful blogs as I would like. Here are a few. I'm sure there are more out there. Let me know your favorites.

<https://karpathy.github.io/>

## Reddit

[r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)
* I don't go to reddit much for finding the latest in ML, but you can definitely find stuff there. There's a weekly WAYR (What Are You Reading) pinned thread which can be good.

There are some other subreddits but I don't use them very much.
